## Lecture 2: Bases of Morals & Ethics

- Sources of Ethics
  - Morals and ethics are: beliefs, assumptions, and values => guides to action
  - The main sources of morals an ethics are considered to be:

- Ethical Progressions
  - Royal/divine legal codes => revealed moral/ethical codes => specialized life codes => ethical philosophies => societal regulations and laws

- Early Codes: Egypt & Mesopotamia
  - Timeline:
    - 2050 BC: Ur-Nammu
    - 1850 BC: Lipit-Ishtar
    - 1780 BC: Hammurabi
    - 1500 BC: Hittite
    - 1100 BC: Assyrian

  - Both bodies of law to be followed and records of how cases had been decided in the past
    - For instance, in Egypt, the Pharaoh

- Early Biblical Material (~1000 BC)
  - Points:
    - You shall not do it, but worship the Lord
    - Judge the slave and the widow/Judge the orphan and the stanger
    - Plead for the infant/plead for the poor and the widow
    - Rehabilitate the

- Revealed Laws - Noahide (Israel, ~600 BC)
  - The Seven Laws for Mankind:
    - You shall practice equity, establish, and promote justice
    - You shall not commit idolatry
    - You shall not commit Blasphemy
    - You shall not commit Sexual Immorality
    - You shall not commit Murder
    - You shall not commit Theft
    - You shall not eat the limb torn from a live animal. Flesh with the life of it, the blood of it, you shall not eat

  - According to Biblical teachings, the first six universal laws were given to Adam, the seventh was added for Noah after the flood

- Revealed Laws - The Decalogue (Israel, ~500 BC)
  - The Ten Commandments:
    - You shall have no other gods before me
    - You shall not make idols to worship them
    - You shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain
    - Remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy
    - Honor your father and mother
    - You shall not murder

    - You shall not steal
    - You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor
    - You shall not covet your neighbor's goods, nor his house, nor his wife, nor his manservant, nor his bull, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor's

  - The Ten Commandments in American Society
    - American society has embraced the Ten Commandments as a historical moral symbol, and as a result various groups believe the Commandments should be part of civic locations such as city halls, courtrooms, etc.
      - Other groups say this would directly violate the Constitutional clause prohibiting "establishment"

- Revealed Christian Doctrine (Israel, ~30 AD)
  - According to the Gospels, Jesus of Nazareth preached:
    - Blessed are the meek, the persecuted, the merciful, the peacemakers
    - Agree with your adversary, murder begins in the heart
    - Turn the other cheek, do not give "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth"
    - Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you

  - These novel teachings emphasized humility, loving kindness, and forgiveness, rather than prohibitions and retribution


- An Essential Idea: The Golden and Silver Rules
  - Judaic: "Silver"
    - "What is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor"
  - Christian: "Golden"
    - "What you would want others to do to you, do so to them"
  - A Golden Conundrum: How do you know what is hateful or desirable to others?
    - Experiential Level
      - Assume homogeneity: everyone thinks the same
      - Emphasize principles over particulars: e.g., pleasure and pain
      - Empathize - do as they would have you do onto them ("Platinum Rule")
      - What is empathy?
        - Empathy is an awareness of other peoples' feelings, needs, and concerns
    - Practical Level
      - Shared Cognitive Models
        - Family and friends
      - Learned Cognitive Models
        - Individuals: psychology
        - Groups: sociology
      - Meta-Cognitive Processes
        - "Thinking about thinking"
        - Create models
        - Test and refine models
    - Analytical Level
      - Ethical philosophies based on normative principles
- Codes: Chivalry (Europe, ~1000 AD)
  - Observe all the Church teaches
  - Defend the Church
  - Do not recoil before your enemy
  - Make war on the non-believer without cessation or mercy
  - Love your country of birth
  - Perform your feudal duties
  - Champion the Right and Good against Injustice and Evil
  - Be generous to everyone
  - Respect all weaknesses and make yourself the defender
  - Never lie and keep your word
- Codes: Bushido, Way of the Warriors (~1100 AD)
  - Stated in different ways, and sometimes involving 8 rather than 7 qualities, the Way of the Warriors appears in Japanese, Chinese, and Korean cultures
- Codes: Magna Carta (England, 1215)
  - A promise by England's King John to his barons that he will "obey the law of the land"
  - Establishes the principle that laws apply to all, even kings
  - Recognizes the rights of individuals within states and elucidates those rights
  - A partial bases for the American Constitution and Bill of Rights
- Codes: Boy Scouts (England, ~1900 AD)
  - Scout Oath:
    - "On my honor, I will do my best, to do my duty, to God and my country, and to obey the Scout Law. To help other people at all times, to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight"
  - Scout Law:
    - "A Scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent"
- Codes: West Point (USA, ~1950 AD)
  - "A cadet will not lie, cheat, or steal, or tolerate those who do!"
  - Simple codes are easy to remember, but in their simplicity, they may neglect more complex ethical and moral issues of great importance
- Codes: Engineering Profession (USA, ~2000 AD)
  - Engineers, in the fulfillment of their professional duties, shall:
    - Hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public
    - Perform services only in the area of their competence
    - Issue public statements only in an objective and truthful manner
    - Act in professional matters for each employer or client as faithful agents or trustees
    - Avoid deceptive acts in the solicitation of professional development
  - Not an exact structure, but a guide
- Morals, Ethics, and the Law
  - Ethics occupy the middle ground between a society's Fundamental Morals and its government's Regulations and Laws
  - Ethics provide direction toward adherence to the Law as well as guidance in ambiguous areas of the law
- Case 1: Creation of Child Labor Laws
  - Child labor played a major role in the European Industrial Revolution
  - More than 50% of children from 5 to 15 worked without regulation
- Case 2: Reversal of Existing Laws
  - In the US, many previously legal practices have been overturned or are being reexamined on the basis of moral or ethical considerations
  - Many further examples in politics, business, sports, and daily life and many of these remain open issues in America and the world
- Case 3: Ethics and Law in Los Angeles
  - House deed
  - Covenants such as these were legal and enforceable in California until they were specifically outlawed by the Rumford Fair Housing Act of 1963
- Case 4: Movement of Technical Knowledge
  - Silicon Valley benefited from California laws allowing virtually free movement of ideas a people changed jobs, but it also becomes known for idea theft and treachery
  - The Defend Trade Secrets Act makes it a Federal crime to move trade secrets from one position to the next
- Ethics, Morality, and Law: Engineering Practice
  - Legal: many of the difficult problems in engineering ethics are inside the boundary of what is legal
  - Illegal: but a number of things that were formerly ethical questions, such as sexual harassment, age discrimination, arbitrary dismissal, and moving trade secrets, are not outside the law
  - Open Issues: many of our current laws are open issues from a national and worldwide perspective, and even some of our well-established laws are being reexamined from ethical, moral, and religious viewpoints
  - The challenge is to establish a solid Personal and Professional Ethical Framework in the face of the continual fluctuation of ethics
- Ethical Action: The Role of Religion
  - While religion can certainly be a guide to ethics, many people, even religious ones, have also sought a secular or non-religious path to ethical behavior
  - America is Becoming More Secular
    - Belief that America is joining societies such as Japan, Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, and Australia that combine social consciousness with a declining religious foundation
    - At the same time, the US Supreme Court is granting more leeway to religious institutions to use their beliefs as the basis for societal decisions and actions
- Ethical Action: The Role of Science
  - The growing field of brain research is hoped to clarify the idea of consciousness and provide a scientific basis for our moral and ethical actions
- Ethical Action: The Role of Reason
  - "Reason has little or no role...", "Moral action depends on reason, but not always...", "Moral action depends on previous reasoning..."
  - Today's ethical philosophies are divided, citing a variety of factors including genetics
- Ethical Action: The Role of Intuition
  - Jonathan Haidt lists six types of moral response that have manifested through intuitive emotional reactions:
    - Care/harm
    - Liberty/oppression
    - Fairness/cheating
    - Loyalty/betrayal
    - Authority/subversion
    - Sanctity/degradation
  - Haidt theorizes that different groups make different use of these basic ingredients to form their moralities and that these evolutionary attitudes contribute more to the control of behavior than does reason
    - Ex) Haidt believes Liberals emphasize the first three, while Conservatives emphasize the last three
- Ethical Action: The Role of Experience
  - "The life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience" - Judge Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.
  - "Learning from experience" undoubtedly includes the ability to reason as well

- Ethical Action: The Role of Choice
  - "An act has no ethical quality whatsoever unless it be chose out of several (acts that are) all equally possible" - William James



## Lecture 3: Ethical Philosophies

- Rights Ethics
  - Fundamental Concepts:
    - Human rights are basic
    - Respect for rights is obligatory

  - Two Types of Rights:
    - Liberty Rights
      - Individuals are the focus
      - Non-interference and property protection

    - Welfare Rights
      - Communities are the focus
      - Promises, covenants, and benefits

  - Examples:
    - Modern rights
      - US Constitutional rights
        - Not limited: the ninth amendment says that just because a right is not mentioned in the Constitution, that right may still belong to the people and it is not denied or criticized

      - Universal Human Rights
      - Digital citizenship rights
        - Defined as the norms of appropriate, responsible behavior with regard to technology use

    - American foundations
      - Declaration of Independence
      - Constitution and Bill of Rights

    - Rights in opposition and application

  - Rights Origins and Issues
    - Where do rights come from?
      - Outside sources: God, nature, natural law
      - Inside sources: history, precedent, reason
      - Wrongs: bad experiences + moral thinking

    - How do rights differ from preferences?
      - Related mainly to governments
      - Extend morals and ethics into law
      - "Super preferences" superseding minor preferences

    - Why are rights important?
      - Restrict the actions of government
      - Protect minority opinions and safety
      - Illuminate society;s essential values

  - Rights are frequently in opposition
  - Morals, Ethics, the Law, and Constitutional Rights
    - Laws are particularly relevant to rights, and laws are changeable

  - Legal Enforcement of Constitutional Rights
    - Federal Government
      - Broadest level of enforcement even when rights are controversial

    - Local Government/Educational/Institutional
      - Generally match federal, but more discretionary and dependent on special local situations

    - Corporate/Business
      - Most specialized and more restrictions on rights of employees

  - The First Amendment
    - The constitutional prohibition is against Congress restricting the right to practice of religion, freedom of speech and the press, or of peaceable assembly
    - These constitutionally recognized rights generally pass down to state and local governments
    - At other societal levels, their interpretation depends strongly on the particular situation, and they can affect engineering practice in a variety of ways

- Duty Ethics
  - Fundamental Concepts:
    - The action determines the ethical content
    - Required duties are actions that reflect basic moral or ethical principles as well as societal standards
    - Duties mirror rights => for each right, there's an associated duty

  - Examples:
    - The Ten Commandments
    - Code of Chivalry
    - Cadet Honor Code
    - Professional Codes

  - Related Issues:
    - Unification principles:
      - Autonomy: man determines morality through reason
      - Universality: principles apply equally to all people
      - Reciprocity: respect for others' desires, needs, and efforts

    - *Kant's Categorical Imperative*
      - First formulation (The Universal Law):
        - "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law"
      - Second formulation (The End in Itself)
        - "So act that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means"

  - Modern Duties
    - The National Society of Professional Engineers holds a code for the fulfillment of professional duties

- Virtue Ethics
  - Fundamental Concepts:
    - Virtues are:
      - Motives, attitudes and emotions
      - Guides to conduct

    - Goal is to be a virtuous person

  - Examples:
    - Religious precepts
    - Asian Warriors' Code
    - Boy Scout Code
    - Modern virtues

  - Related Ideas:
    - Plato's *Cardinal Virtues*
    - Aristotle's *Golden Mean*

  - Cardinal Virtues
    - Greek "Cardinal" virtues of Plato and Aristotle were mainly intended for wealthy, land-owning males
    - Roman virtues of Cicero were intended for civic leaders of the more expansive and militant Roman Empire
    - Christian fundamental virtues are intended for all belivers and have transcendental and historical roots
    - Virtues are values expressed as permanent modes of behavior

  - The Golden Mean
    - Aristotle taught that while virtues are good, a deficiency in a virtue would be a vice and an excess of that virtue would also be a vice

  - Modern Virtues
    - Other authors may have other favorite virtues, but agree that virtue ethics provides a useful way of addressing engineering problems, and that both the engineer and those around her benefit from its application

- Utilitarianism
  - Fundamental Concepts:
    - The consequences of an action determine the ethical content
    - Consequences are a balance of good (benefits) vs. bad (costs)
    - Ethical consequences give "the most happiness for the most people"

  - Examples:
    - Cars: speed and convenience vs. safety and economy
    - Air and water pollution: public health vs. industrial defense
    - Genetically engineered foods: societal benefits vs. ecological risks

  - Cautions:
    - Inequitable distribution of happiness
    - Neglect of societal relations and values in the interest of results
    - Unforeseen consequences
    - Actions that are basically wrong, whatever the consequences

- Pragmatism
  - Fundamental Concepts:
    - Context, in which facts and values must be balances
    - Analysis: ethical reasoning vs. fixed rules or ideals
    - Flexibility, in integrating and harmonizing competing values

  - Related Principles:
    - Guidance: methods of analytical thought
    - Warning: against generalizing from specific areas

- Alternative Ethical Frameworks
  - Non-Judeo/Christian: Islamic, Buddhist, Hindu, etc.
  - Non-Religious: Secular Hominism, Atheism
  - Non-Male Centered: Feminist
  - Non-Adult Centered: Fetal, Infant, and Child Rights
  - Non-Human Centered: Animal, AI Entities, and Nature Rights
  - Non-Democratic: Dictatorship, Monarchy, Theocracy
  - Non-Political: Libertarian, Anarchistic
  - Non-Martial: Pacifistic
  - Non-Altruistic: Objectivist (Ayn Rand-ism)
  - Non-Essentialist: Existentialist

- Conclusion
  - It is almost impossible today not to violate somebody's ethical principles, no matter what you do
  - On the other hand, having a variety of ethical sources and philosophies gives you more material with which to build your Personal Ethical Framework

  - Do general and personal good
  - Provide an immediate goal

- The Two Cultures
  - Observation that the portion of British society that had received a university education was split into those educated in the sciences and those educated in the humanities
    - Main issue was that the great majority of British leaders were part of the humanities culture and had more and more issues related to science and technology
    - Argument that society's leaders were poorly prepared to carry out their responsibility for solving society's problems of the day and of the future
    - Proposal for cross education in universities => not well received and modern universities are even more specialized than before

  - New problem: when it comes to science and technology, things move so quickly that political leaders aren't leading, they're struggling to keep up
    - Internet, biotechnology, gene editing, social media, data acquisition, surveillance technology, etc.
    - Conclusion: cross education of leaders would be relatively useless, instead, we need the engineers and scientists must make themselves aware of the consequences of their work

  - Note the frequent discrepancy between how engineers see themselves and how others see them
    - Engineers typically see themselves as creative, wide ranging, solution oriented, and rational
    - The public tends to see engineers as overly analytical, unbounded, emphasizing problems over people, and consequently dangerous
      - Must be taken into account when communicating our solutions to the public at large
      - The ethical and societal implications of our work have to be conveyed along with the technical details

- Existential Ethics and Decision-Making
  - A definition of ethics that would be generally accepted without comment is: "Ethics is a set of ideas and rules by which to live"
    - Better definition for this class: "Ethics is not only a set of ideas and rules by which to live; but ethics is fundamentally a set of acts based on ideas and rules by which to live"

  - Base idea that existence precedes essence
    - A person is what he or she does, rather than does because of what he or she is
    - Acts are more important than words, and this acts define a person's ethical structure, not his or her pronouncements

  - Decisions are actions, and engineers are required to make decisions continually, thus establishing the basis for defining their ethical framework
    - Engineering decisions often are simultaneously analytical and probabilistic
    - Engineers are often alright with time constraints on their decisions
    - More and more, engineering decisions are multiperson and multiorganizations
    - Generally involve both technical and societal factors
    - Engineering decisions are consequential, with consequences today happening at a speed and to an extent never before experienced
      - One wrong engineering decision can have an instantaneous and serious effect on millions or even billions of people

    - Ethics is sometimes the controlling factor, meaning that ethical considerations are more important than the financial ones
      - More frequently, ethical or societal considerations are another factor in the overall decision-making process

    - Ethical decision-making is the natural product of an ethical culture
      - Can be expressed at the team and group level within an organization, as organizational standards and operating principles
      - The higher we go, the more difficult it becomes to instantiate such a culture

    - Ethical decision-making depends on two questions:
      - "What do you stand for?"
      - "What do you do about it?"

  - Emphasis on the difference between "having ethics" and "being ethical"
    - When the course is over, we "have ethics"
    - The task of "being ethical" is a lifelong undertaking that depends on our actions

- The Engineering Profession
  - The environment in which engineers practice has changed dramatically over the years
  - Engineers have gone from a simple employee of a company to more of an entrepreneur with a company of his or her own, or a serial employee
  - Consequences of engineering work have grown more immediate, transparent, and widespread
  - Engineers have two main sources of professional ethics:
    - Outside sources, like the ethical codes of the various engineering fields and the codes of overarching societies for general engineering
    - The personal ethical framework of the individual engineer




## Reading 2: Ethical Bases

- Sources of Morals and Ethics
  - Descriptive ethics deals with describing existing ethical systems
  - Normative ethics deals with determining right choices and actions
  - The sources of morals and ethics are divided into the following six main categories:
    - Biological
      - Increasing evidence that we are in some way genetically hard-wired for fairness in the same way we appear to be wired for quickly learning to speak and recognize social relationships
      - Ex) Monkey trials
      - If this were true, we could depend on this assumedly universal source in more complicated social enterprises
        - May be too optimistic

    - Natural
      - Universal moral and ethical truths are self-evident in nature
        - Formed by a transcendental source and accordingly built into human beings
        - We can understand these laws if we look carefully around us and reason accordingly

      - The idea of Natural Law is especially important in the US since our founding fathers incorporated it into the Declaration of Independence

    - Revelation
      - We don't have to reason our way to morals and ethics because they are simply given to us by a higher authority
      - Many forms: direct orders, written injunctions, speaking through prophets, signs and wonders, etc.
        - Have to be interpreted by religious officials, prophets, or other messengers

      - Old, but still a large part of society's current ethical conversation

    - Philosophical
      - Attempts to guide ethical actions through systematic formulation of what is right and wrong
      - Conceptual formulations arrived at by a combination of observation and reasoning

    - Societal
      - We absorb descriptive and normative ethical precepts and influences from the society we live in
        - As well as from other societies we visit/are aware of
        - Come to us in the conventions of everyday interactions, in political debates and decisions as conveyed by the news media, and also from the historical record we study in school or on our own

      - Subject to change, even rapid change within a lifetime or in the space of a few decades
        - With the advent of the Internet and improved travel, we are privy to many more different sets of societal ethics than were available previously

    - Cultural and Individual
      - Strongly influenced by the ethical sources closest to us
        - Family (immediate and extended), religion, and ethnicity
        - Friends and neighborhood
        - Race, gender, political affinity, topical issues, etc.


- Ethical Progressions
  - Royal/divine legal codes => revealed moral/ethical codes => specialized life codes => ethical philosophies => societal regulations and laws
    - Feedforward: the direct influence of historical morals and ethics on laws and regulations
    - Feedback: sometimes laws and regulations have a disruptive effect on existing societal, moral, and ethical beliefs
- Moral Revelations
  - Ancient Codes
    - We gain insight into our very priorities of fairness and justice from codes associated with very early societies
      - Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, Rome, etc.
      - Earliest societies were ruled by kings considered both human and divine, and were therefore absolute in their power
      - The "law" was the prerogative of kings and priests, but could be influenced by societal custom
    - Code of Hammurabi
      - Presented as representing right and justice and being in the interest of the oppressed, those most in need of right judgement
      - Harsh punishments, deals with property ownership
      - Details three levels of justice: aristocrats, commoners, and slaves, with punishments becoming more severe as the person's social status drops
    - Justice is a dominant theme
  - The Old Testament
    - Said to draw much from the Code of Hammurabi
      - Emphasis on justice and similar levels of harshness of penalties
    - The earliest fragment contains the themes of justice and the rights of the least
    - The Jewish Torah/Books of Moses contains two main sets of laws:
      - The Noahide laws (laws for all of humanity)
        - You shall practice equity, establish and promote justice
        - You shall not commit idolatry
        - You shall not commit blasphemy
        - You shall not commit sexual immorality
        - You shall not commit murder
        - You shall not commit theft
        - You shall not eat the limb torn from a live animal; flesh with the life of it, the blood of it, you shall not eat
      - The Ten Commandments/the Decalogue (laws for the Jewish people)
        - You shall have no other gods before me
        - You shall not make idols to worship them
        - You shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain
        - Remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy
        - Honor your father and mother
        - You shall not murder
        - You shall not commit adultery
        - You shall not steal
        - You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor
        - You shall not covet your neighbor's goods, nor his house, nor his wife, nor his manservant, ... nor anything that is your neighbor's
    - Much of American society has embraced the Ten Commandments as a historical moral symbol
      - Debate about separation of church and state
      - Public has expressed its embrace of the laws through the practice of merchandizing
  - The New Testament
    - Christian teaching diverges from the Old Testament both in its emphasis and in its particulars
    - Jesus didn't abandon the Torah, but his teachings were novel in that they emphasized humility, loving kindness, and forgiveness rather than prohibitions and retribution
      - Turning the other cheek, loving your enemies, doing good to those who hate you, etc.
    - Stark contrast to the history of warfare, vengeance, and revenge that preceded this time and the Jewish revolt against Roman occupation during it
  - An Essential Idea: The Golden Rule
    - Both the Torah and the New Testaments have associated with them attempts to condense their ethical teachings into one simple sentence
      - Creation of The Golden Rule: "What is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor."
    - A problem with the rule (The Golden Conundrum): how do you know what is desirable or hateful to others?
      - Assume homogeneity, that everyone thinks the same
      - Consider principles over particulars => requires empathy
        - Empathy is often a key component and often the sole component of ethical behavior
    - How do we learn empathy?
      - On a practical level, we learn to empathize through the use of cognitive models, which we call our ideas of how others think
        - Shared cognitive models are what we believe we have with our family and close friends, although this belief is frequently mistaken
        - Learned cognitive models are what, in the case of individuals, we ascribe to the field of sociology
        - We apply metacognition to test and refine our models, meaning thinking about thinking
      - On an analytical level, issues of empathy are often built into ethical philosophies
        - Ways to put ethical considerations into a universal perspective, such as rights or duties
- Some Ethical Life Codes
  - Code of Chivalry
    - Most closely associated with knights, but was most likely also adhered to by other members of the feudal aristocracy
    - Described as:
      - Observe all the Church teaches
      - Defend the Church
      - Do not recoil before your enemy
      - Make war on the non-believer without cessation or mercy
      - Love your country of birth
      - Perform your feudal duties
      - Champion the right and good against injustice and evil
      - Be generous to everyone
      - Respect all weaknesses and make yourself their defender
      - Never lie, and keep your word
    - Note the following:
      - The Code urges fidelity to the Catholic Church, but appears to directly contradict Christ's teaching on loving one's enemies
      - Emphasizes both nationalism and loyalty
      - Incorporates championing the right and good and protecting the weak
      - Incorporates a dictum, which became a bulwark of both English and American character: "Never lie, and keep your word"
  - Warrior's Code
    - The Code of Chivalry is closely mirrored in a different feudal system, appearing in Japanese, Chinese, and Korean cultures
      - Called Bushido, the Way of the Warriors
    - Qualities appear as follows:
      - Justice (gi)
      - Bravery (yuu)
      - Benevolence (jin)
      - Veracity (makoto)
      - Politeness (rei)
      - Honor (meiyo)
      - Loyalty (chuugi)
    - Note the following:
      - Bravery is linked to justice rather than simply to loyalty
      - A true Bushido warrior was expected to be educated, to appreciate beauty in the arts, to run an efficient household, and to provide motivation to the people who supported him
      - Seems to be a more sophisticated code of ethical behavior than that of Chivalry
  - Code of Magna Carta
    - Establishes the very important and revolutionary principle that laws apply even for kings
      - Limits the power of the ruler, despite the belief that he rules by Divine Right
      - Recognizes the rights of individuals within nations
    - Considered a highly significant landmark in establishing the Rule of Law as a dominant principle in Western societies
      - Recognized as providing a partial basis for our Constitution and Bill of Rights
  - Boy Scout Code
    - Scout Oath and Scout Law
    - Such ethical codes may prove inadequate as times change, and may also change with time
  - Cadet Honor Code
    - "A cadet will not lie, cheat or steal, or tolerate those who do"
    - Advantage of simplicity, being easy to learn and remember
    - Disadvantage that simplicity doesn't cover all bases
      - Serious problems of racial/sexual/religious intolerance and harassment, which are not covered by the Honor Code
      - Requires adjustment to adapt
  - Engineering Professional Codes
    - Engineers shall:
      - Hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public
      - Perform services only in areas of their competence
      - Issue public statements only in an objective and truthful manner
      - Act for each employer or client as faithful agents or trustees
      - Avoid deceptive acts
      - Conduct themselves honorably, responsibly, ethically, and lawfully so as to enhance the honor, reputation, and usefulness of the profession
    - These are admirable goals and straightforwardly state, but have issues:
      - How much safety, health, and welfare in light of other considerations such as cost and public sentiment
      - What are the areas of competence in today's fast-changing technical environment?
      - Are today's entrepreneurial engineers really only faithful agents or trustees of an employer or client?
      - When should they not be trustees, and become whistle-blowers?
      - Few of the canons deal with large societal, moral, or ethical issues
    - Overall question is whether professional codes of this type are still appropriate and adequate for today's more complex world
      - Appropriate as guidance, but not adequate for individual ethical decision-making, which requires a strong Personal Ethical Framework and a good knowledge of current societal-technical issues
- Morals, Ethics, and the Law
  - Ethics serves several critical purposes:
    - Ethics provides direction toward adherence to the Law as well as guidance in ambiguous areas of the Law
    - Moral and ethical principles often create new laws when there is sufficient political and/or public support
    - The reverse is also true, laws become outmoded or unenforceable when the moral and/or ethical climate surrounding them changes
  - Example 1: Initiation of Child Labor Laws
  - Example 2: Reversal of Existing Laws
    - Fundamentally changed: slavery, segregation, discrimination, disenfranchisement, subjugation of women, contraception/abortion, interracial marriage, same-sex marriage, LGBTQ+ rights
    - Still being resolved: government surveillance, cruel and unusual punishment, torture for interrogation, death penalty for crimes, chemical/biological weapons, sale of body parts, treatment of animals, regulation of industrial pollution, etc.
    - Society's ethical values are constantly in flux and the law changes accordingly
  - Example 3: Close to Home
    - Restrictive covenants against races on deeds
  - Example 4: Movement of Technical Knowledge
    - Ex) Silicon Valley
    - Allowance of free movement of ideas as people changed jobs => now criminalized
  - Implications for Engineering Practice
    - Legal
      - Many of the difficult problems in engineering ethics lie inside the boundary of what is legal
    - Illegal
      - Those in charge of corporate or organizational ethical codes or frameworks have to investigate carefully which decisions are ethical and which are mandated by law
    - Open Issues
      - Many of our current laws remain open issues from both a national and an international perspective
      - Differences in local laws as well as local customs have to be taken into account when making ethical choices
      - Some of our well-established social justice laws are being reexamined from new ethical and moral viewpoints
- Ethical Action: Major Influences
  - Role of Religion
    - Some devout persons will say their entire personal ethical framework is based on biblical sources of one form or another
    - Ex) Thomas Jefferson, Dalai Lama
    - While religion can certainly be a guide to ethics, many people have sought a secular or nonreligious path to ethical behavior
  - Role of Science
    - Attempt to fully understand how the brain functions, including the neurophysiological correlates of consciousness, and with these, the real bases for ethical thought and action
  - Role of Reason
    - Ethical philosophers are divided about how much reasoning affects ethical action
  - Role of Intuition
    - Six basic types of moral responses:
      - Care/harm
      - Liberty/oppression
      - Fairness/cheating
      - Loyalty/betrayal
      - Authority/subversion
      - Sanctity/degradation
    - Different groups make different use of these basic ingredients to form their ethical frameworks and these evolutionary attitudes contribute more to the control of behavior than does reason
      - Ex) Democrat vs. Republican
  - Role of Experience
    - What we have seen, what we have undergone, and how we have reacted previously is also an important component of ethical action
- Summary
  - Started with main sources, looked at ancient history, examined life codes, dissected the relationship among morals, ethics, and the law, and described some factors that affect immediate ethical action
  - An unstructured set of ethics includes a vast number of influences that are difficult to arrange in a way useful for ethical decision-making and subsequent action
  - Systems have been established to attempt to provide principles by means of which individuals and groups can address ethical problems as they arise, and make rational decisions



## Reading 3: Ethical Philosophies

- Introduction
  - Ethical philosophies are ways to systematize, rationalize, and prescribe societal and personal ethical choices
  - Philosophies give us the means for thinking rationally about ethical problems, and often help point the way to their solution
  - We look at five major philosophies: rights ethics, duty ethics, virtue ethics, utilitarianism, pragmatism
    - These have a direct impact on major current societal issues, as well as on issues of engineering practice

- Rights Ethics
  - Concepts and Issues
    - The idea that there are basic human rights that must be respected is almost universal
      - Fundamental to the formation of the US
    - We recognize two main types of rights:
      - Liberty Rights
        - Focus is the individual
        - A major principle is non-interference by other people or other agencies
      - Welfare Rights
        - Focus is the community
        - Major concerns are what rights people have within the community and what peoples' obligations to the community are
      - The distinctions and contradictions between these two types of rights contribute to the political narrative of the US and other countries
    - Recognize that there are many compendiums of rights, and we consider three types of rights that can affect ethical engineering practice:
      - United States Constitutional Rights
        - Particularly those in the Bill of Rights
      - Universal Human Rights
        - As stated in the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights
      - Digital Citizenship Rights
        - A new set of rights articulated in response to the rapid growth of our interconnected society based on digital technology
  - Constitutional Rights
    - The basic justification for separation is given in terms of the Laws of Nature and Nature's God
    - “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness”
      - Slavery exists as a contradiction to this statement => understood, but avoided to prevent the alienation of the South
    - Note that the list of inalienable rights includes only the "pursuit of happiness," and not happiness itself
      - Founders felt no government could guarantee this
    - The preamble states the government's and people's relationship to these rights
      - The government's role is to secure these rights
      - The people's role is to ensure that the government does its job
  - Rights Origins and Oppositions
    - Where do rights come from?
      - Our founders believed that basic human rights derived from outside sources (God, Nature, Natural Law)
      - Others write that rights can derive from reasoning and the studied consideration of history, experience, and precedent
    - How do rights differ from preferences?
      - Think of rights as "super preferences" that supersede minor preferences
      - Recognize that societal rights are related mainly to government, and that they serve to extend morals and ethics into law
        - Important to society in three critical ways:
          - They serve to restrict the actions of government
          - They protect minority opinions and safety against actions of the majority that might undermine basic rights
          - Consideration of rights in difficult cases serves to illuminate society's essential values
    - Today, we're also concerned with rights that do not appear in the Constitution
      - Ex) Privacy, healthcare, education, freedom from poverty, etc.
      - In engineering, we're often concerned with the rights of modern technical organizations and the rights of individuals within organizations
  - Levels of Constitutional Rights
    - There are three levels of American constitutional rights:
      - Federal Government
        - The Federal Government has clear jurisdiction in the public sphere
        - Constitutional rights are generally interpreted most broadly, even when the interpretation is controversial
      - Local Government/Institutional/Educational
        - The interpretation of constitutional rights may be somewhat more discretionary
        - State and local governments may try to stretch constitutional restrictions until the Supreme Court steps in with its interpretation and ruling
        - Application of the rights may be largely a matter of principle and can be more restrictive than the Constitution
      - Corporate/Business
        - Most specialized interpretation of constitutional rights
        - Most often at the discretion of the corporate or business management
        - Recent events have highlighted limitations on this general principle of no abridgment of rights
    - Issues of constitutional rights become more complex within institutions and the business workplace

  - Universal Human Rights
    - Universal rights are rights that are designed to transcend rights granted by individual countries
      - These rights can also affect ethical engineering decisions
      - Spelled out in The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which is considered a foundational text in the history of human and civil rights
  - Digital Citizenship Rights
    - New set of rights that has been advanced with the digital age
    - "Digital citizenship can be defined as the norms of appropriate, responsible behavior with regard to technology use"
    - Nine key areas:
      - Digital access: full electronic participation in society
      - Digital commerce: electronic buying and selling of goods
      - Digital communication: electronic exchange of information
      - Digital literacy: teaching and learning about technology and its use
      - Digital etiquette: electronic standards of conduct or procedure
      - Digital law: electronic responsibility for actions and deeds
      - Digital rights & responsibilities: those freedoms extended to everyone
      - Digital health & wellness: physical and psychological well-being
      - Digital security: electronic precautions to guarantee personal safety

- Duty Ethics
  - Concepts and Issues
    - The fundamental concept of duty ethics is that the action a person takes determines the ethical content
      - Philosophies of duty ethics generally specify the required duties, and they are assumed to reflect the fundamental morals and ethics, as well as the norms of society
    - Duties can be considered the mirror image of rights
      - If rights are inalienably granted to humans, it's the responsibility of the human to observe and protect those rights
      - One way to approach duty ethics is to say that each identified right has a duty associated with it
      - Another way is to establish basic principles upon which duties are constructed
        - This is the more traditional approach to duty ethics, called deontological ethics, or deontology
    - To whom are what are duties owed? Why should we carry out ethical actions?
      - The simplest answer is: "because it's right to do so"
        - Not a fully satisfying reason from a humanistic/practical standpoint
      - We often find that people feel an ethical obligation to other people
        - Ethical obligation to people in the situation with them, rather than an overarching loyalty to higher authorities
      - Philosophers developing principles of duty ethics tend to focus on broader obligations, focusing on several key principles called unification principles:
        - Autonomy: man can determine morality through reason
        - Universality: ethical obligations apply equally to all people
        - Reciprocity: ethical duties entail respect for others' desires and needs
  - The Categorical Imperative
    - Presented in two formulations:
      - The Universal Law
        - "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law"
        - Only take actions that you would want everybody else to be required to take
        - Does not mean you should only take actions that everybody else is already taking
        - Puts you in virtual charge of actions for all of mankind that is in the same ethical situation
      - The End in Itself
        - "So act that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means"
        - One must recognize that all people have intrinsic value and rights, and that therefore ethical actions must not use people as means of achieving some purpose that doesn't benefit them
        - People must always be treated as the end of actions, not as a means of facilitating actions
  - Duties for Modern Engineers
    - Peterson's *12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos*
      - Peterson's 12 rules/ethical duties:
        - Stand up straight with your shoulders back
        - Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping
        - Make friends with people who want the best for you
        - Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today
        - Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them
        - Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world
        - Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient)
        - Tell the truth — or at least, don’t lie
        - Assume that the person you’re listening to might know something you don’t
        - Be precise in your speech
        - Don’t try to dispense with risk and danger
        - Learn to take the bad with the good
      - Focus on personal responsibility before then going on to cure the world
      - Has a traditional ring: new problems have, in most cases, not generated radically new solutions
    - Association of Computing Machinery's code:
      - Contribute to society and human well-being
      - Avoid harm to others
      - Be honest and trustworthy
      - Be fair, take action not to discriminate
      - Honor property rights, that is, copyrights and patents
      - Give proper credit for intellectual property
      - Respect the privacy of others
      - Honor confidentiality
    - Some feel that a general code, while well meaning, does not go far enough
      - Belief that the expanding influence of engineering brings with it a duty that has not yet been fulfilled
      - A proactive duty that goes beyond the reactive duties propounded by engineering professional societies

- Virtue Ethics

  - Concepts and Issues

    - Virtues are personal characteristics that give rise to ethical actions
      - Ex) Attitudes, motivations, and emotions
    - The goal of virtue ethics is that one should be a virtuous person
      - Encompass in one's personality and subsequent behavior characteristics that are beneficial to society
      - Should be done within reason
  - The Cardinal Virtues and their Evolution

    - Greek Cardinal Virtues

      - Plato:
        - Wisdom: the ability to choose a proper course of action for a given situation at the right time
        - Courage: the ability to confront danger and uncertainty and to continue to act appropriately and effectively
        - Temperance: the ability to practice self-control, restraint, and discretion, sometimes translated as sound-mindedness
        - Justice: the ability to act fairly in matters requiring judgement, also translated as righteousness
      - Influenced Roman ethical thought as well as subsequent Christian ethical philosophy
      - Mainly intended for wealthy, land-owning males, and not for the public at large
      - Considered justice the most important and extensive virtue
        - Many others have considered courage the most important virtue since it enables the rest

    - Roman Cardinal Virtues

      - Cicero:
        - Wisdom: essentially the same as the Greek definition
        - Greatness of spirit: encompassing courage, but also including the idea of knowing one's own ethical framework, or being aware of one's virtues
        - Decorum: perhaps an extension of the Romans' well-known enthusiasm for parties, the idea of keeping things quiet, particularly with regard to the hoi polloi (the common people)
        - Justice: again, similar to the Greek definition
        - Liberality: the quality of giving back in a generous manner, often exercised by generals and statesmen who returned some of their accumulated wealth to the people in the form of temples, games, or distributions of food and drink
      - Recognized a large number of other values, both personal and social, in relation to their ideal of the complete person

    - Christian Cardinal Virtues

      - Return to the Greek Cardinal Virtues, but with the following added on:
        - Faith: a commitment to God and to doing good works while being a witness to Christianity
        - Hope: specifically the desire for eternal life in heaven, but more generally, an application of faith to life on Earth
        - Love: following Jesus' teachings to love others as well as God, and expressing that love as charity toward others
      - Love and charity are considered the most important virtues in Catholic doctrine, because they give life to the other virtues
      - Christian philosophy treats the seven virtues as revealed knowledge and as applicable for all believers

    - The Golden Mean

      - Aristotle taught that there is a "Golden Mean" to virtues

        - While virtues are good, both a deficiency in a virtue and an excess of that virtue would be a vice

      - | Vice of Deficiency | Virtuous Mean | Vice of Excess |
        | :----------------: | :-----------: | :------------: |
        |     Cowardice      |    Courage    |    Rashness    |
        |    Illiberality    |  Liberality   |  Prodigality   |
        |   Spiritlessness   |  Good Temper  |  Irascibility  |
        |    Depreciation    |   Sincerity   |  Boastfulness  |

      - The mean is not the same for everyone and depends on the circumstances

        - It's an individual's responsibility to become more autonomous, moving away from arbitrary rules and authority figures to develop their own virtue-centered morality

    - Virtues for Modern Engineers

      - Svend Brinkman's *Resisting the Self-Improvement Craze*
        - Advocates a return to old-fashioned virtues:
          - Integrity: keeping faith with your ethical framwork
          - Self-control
          - Character: incorporating positive virtues, performing ethical duties
          - Dignity: maintaining a steady demeanor, even in hard circumstances
          - Loyalty: not abdicating your obligations to groups or individuals
          - Rootedness: knowing where you came from and your ethical sources
          - Adherence to obligation: keeping promises, performing duties
          - Respect for tradition: where warranted and ethically appropriate
        - Particularly weighted toward the supposed "good old days" of moral and certainty
        - Largely consistent with progressive ethical ideas
      - Shiva's blog
        - Takes a more forward view:
          - Openness: which can include awareness of new solutions
          - Acceptance of limitations: which also pertains to setting of technical requirements and specifications
          - Honesty: which is an obligation to be truthful and open
          - Deciphering criticism in the right way
          - Thirst for learning and proactiveness: which talks to the important role of engineers in solving problems of the 21st century
          - Willingness to take risks: which recognizes that engineers sometimes have to undertake worthwhile projects with a significant chance of failure in order to advance a field of science or technology
      - Virtue ethics provides a useful way of addressing today's critical engineering issues, and that both the engineer and those around them can benefit from its use

- Utilitarianism

  - Concepts and Issues
    - The ethical content of utilitarianism is assumed to be in the consequences of the action
      - Also called Consequentialism
      - Consequences are a balance of good (in the form of benefits, convenience, safety, comfort, etc.) and bad (in the form of costs, inconvenience, displacement, danger, etc.)
      - The most ethical choice is the one in which the consequence has the greatest margin of good over bad
        - The consequence "that produces the most happiness for the most people"
    - Engineers are comfortable with the Utilitarian philosophy because it involves the decisions we make continually
  - Cautions
    - In practicality, this philosophy has a number of problems, called cautions:
      - Unforeseen Consequences
        - Dependent on ethical content being contained in the consequences of actions
        - However, it's not always possible to understand all of the consequences of an action in advance
      - Inequitable Distribution of Happiness
        - Happiness for "the most people" doesn't always guarantee a fair outcome
        - Often necessary to focus on the people being left out, as they may be the poorest, or most poorly represented
        - Avoiding a substantial portion of unhappiness for a few people might be the most important factor in making an ethical choice
      - Societal Values
        - Engineers are frequently accused of focusing on technical solutions to problems and neglecting the societal implication of those solutions
        - Solutions may undermine long-term societal values or conditions that are important to uphold
    - Important to recognize that some actions are basically wrong, even if their consequences could be beneficial
      - In these cases, the weight of ethical content lies in the action, and not in the consequence

- Pragmatism

  - Concepts and Issues
    - The fundamental concepts of pragmatism are the following:
      - There is a specific, well-defined context, the problem space, within which facts and values must be balanced
      - The solution will usually require ethical reasoning rather than adherence to fixed rules or ideals
      - There must also be some flexibility in integrating and harmonizing competing values in order to arrive at a satisfactory solution
    - In engineering, we refer to "point solutions", which are solutions that are not generalizable or scalable, and are treated as less valuable
      - Important to realize that a series of ethical point solutions can do a lot toward moving a socio-technological area forward
  - Conclusions
    - A characteristic of pragmatic solutions, as with Utilitarian ones, is that they are dynamic
      - The solution is a compromise among a variety of factors which may change
      - The principles in contention may also evolve, changing the solution with time
    - The key lessons of pragmatism:
      - Cases are concrete dilemmas with differing ethical opinions
      - Emphasizing principles over particulars often leads to accentuation of differences
      - Emphasizing particulars over principles can lead to reconciliation of differences

- Alternative Ethical Frameworks

  - There are other pathways as well:
    - Non-Judeo/Christian: there are Islamic, Buddhist, Hindu, and a host of frameworks starting from other roots and encompassing many but not all of the same ethical considerations
    - Nonreligious: as was pointed out by the Dalai Lama, there are numerous frameworks derived from a secular perspective, sometimes called Secular Humanism, but which might admit some higher influences
      - At the end of this spectrum are frameworks derived from Atheism, which unequivocally rejects all transcendental roots
    - Nonmale centered: there are feminist frameworks that attempt to begin with considerations of nurturing, compassion, and inclusiveness rather than rights of property owners and slave-holders, a criticism made of early Western codes including the Old Testament
    - Nonadult centered: these frameworks center on the rights of fetuses, of infants and of children
      - In a sense, they are an extension of child labor laws, but the philosophies behind them are broader and more universal
    - Nonhuman centered: current ethical debates include questions of current animal rights and, in particular, the rights of our close cousins, the primates, who are still used a laboratory subjects without their consent
      - As DNA engineering progresses, these animals and others may gain abilities to speak and to write
        - What will be their place in society then?
      - In addition, issues of pollution and climate have focused attention on the rights of nature itself:
        - Do trees and forests have a right to life?
        - What are the rights of the ecosystem?
    - Nondemocratic: dictatorships, monarchies, and theocracies still exist in the world
      - These forms of government are much different from ours with sometimes fundamentally different sets of rights and duties
    - Nonpolitical: again, there is a spectrum from Libertarian thought, which advocates a minimum government concerned with defense and little else, to Anarchistic thought, which advocates for virtually no government at all
    - Nonmartial: this philosophy builds a pacifistic framework based on the complete rejection of militarism and war, certainly not a mainstay of most Western philosophies
    - Non-capitalistic: these frameworks, as Socialism and Communism, which hardly exist today in their originally conceived form, still advocate extensive state involvement in social and economic matters
    - Non-altruistic: the objectivist philosophy associated with Ayn Rand, author of *The Fountainhead* and *Atlas Shrugged* advocates for fair exchange of goods and services, rejecting such one-sided acts as those of charity
    - Nonessentialist: this is the Existentialist philosophy we introduced in Chapter 1, which basically says our character is determined by our actions and not a result of our natural being
  - Having available a variety of ethical sources and philosophies gives you more material with which to build your personal ethical framework and with which to address ethical problems in your engineering career



## Reading 4: Effective Teams and Leadership

- Introduction
  - Important for engineers to know and understand the factors that help determine successful teams and effective leadership
- Engineering is Fundamentally Social
  - Fundamentally social in two ways:
    - Engineering's broad relationship with society
      - Virtually every facet of modern society is dependent on interactions with engineering
        - Ex) business, medicine, infrastructure, energy, transportation, communication, entertainment, art, etc.

    - People-centered
      - Engineering is people-centered externally in its response to critical societal needs and constraints
      - Engineering is people-centered internally in the social dimensions of engineering team processes
- Engineering is a Team Sport
  - Like in sports, engineering teams compete
    - If the team is part of a company, it competes for the acquisition of projects
    - Once a project is secured, the team competes for internal resources in the form of facilities, equipment, and personnel
    - If the project results in a commercial product, the team competes or marketing attention, advertising budget, and sales against other products

  - Also like in sports, teams are rewarded and penalized for their performance
    - The rewards of winning are real and substantial
      - Winning improves team members' job security and salary, their career path, and their ability to make contributions to their organization and to society

    - Losing isn't disastrous, but is obviously less beneficial
      - Can still gain experience, technical knowledge, and positive exposure in a loss

  - A team's winning or losing depends on two sets of skills:
    - Taskwork Skills
      - Technical capabilities
      - Name that research psychologists give to the ability to carry out complicated tasks
      - Include deep knowledge in relevant technical disciplines and the ability to translate that knowledge into workable designs and successful systems or products

    - Teamwork Skills
      - Capability of team members and leaders to operate effectively and successfully as a team
      - Include a variety of methodological and social factors
      - In many cases, teamwork skills are as important and sometimes more important than technical skills
- Competencies of Top Executives and Managers
  - Recognition that women and men with organizational, team building, and leadership skills are what we would expect at the top of any good organization
    - Same with the ability to cope with the inevitable problems that arise
    - Low importance attributed to technological skills

  - Due to project managers' close connection with their team's members, interpersonal skills, and communication
    - Ability to resolve differences and reach conclusions without offending or alienating the team members is also necessary
- Social Factors Affecting Team Performance
  - Overall
    - Essential factors with demonstrable effect on team performance:
      - Communication
      - Leadership
      - Emotional Intelligence

  - Communication
    - Engineering team members must be able to communicate effectively if they are to solve ethical as well as technical problems
    - Four main factors:
      - Exchanging
        - Involves two processes:
          - Presenting
            - The effective use of language, the ability to speak presentably, and the ability to persuade others
            - Fear of public speaking can be suppressed through awareness, practice, and experience

          - Listening
            - Includes paying attention, inquiring, clarifying, summarizing, reflecting, not thinking about something else, and not interrupting
            - Effective listening sometimes involves as much thought and effort as effective presenting

      - Supporting
        - Promoting supportive activities within the team and establishing an overall supportive environment in the larger organization
        - Two internal team factors:
          - Interpersonal
            - Includes assuming others' opinions are useful, pointing out positive aspects, creating opportunities for others to speak, and building on others' ideas
            - Experienced and knowledgeable team members can make valuable contributions even if they do not have advanced degrees

          - Personal
            - Includes being open, friendly, empathetic, motivating, not controlling, not criticizing a person's character or attributes, and not using negative body language while another person is presenting
            - A verbal or written compliment on work well done is always welcome
            - Criticism, if necessary, should be work related and not involve personality issues, unless these are violating team or corporate ethical principles against harassment or other offensive behaviors

        - Creating a generally supportive environment is a responsibility of organizational leaders or company executives, and should be planned and not left up to chance

      - Differing
        - When alternative options are associated with different team members, a main objective in considering them is to separate egos from ideas, letting the best ideas win, and not the biggest ego
        - Two components:
          - Intra-team
            - Deal with intra-team conflicts by arguing constructively within the context of the problem
            - Avoid at all costs arguments that focus on the character and identity of the opponent

          - Individual
            - Objective is not to retreat or change your position just to avoid a confrontation
            - Realize that confrontation of one type or another is inevitable as part of team problem solving
              - Do it thoughtfully and respectfully so that all the confronters come away feeling satisfied

        - Best result of differing is a consensus solution, which may include components from various sources, but is above all one that every participant can subscribe to
        - Solutions that are imposed by dictum of the leader/upper management rarely survive the subsequent team effort

      - Participating
        - All members participate in the process, incorporating previous behaviors in their participation
        - Two main considerations:
          - By the Leader
            - Leader must involve all team members, giving each an equal chance to contribute and not letting one or two dominate

          - By the Member
            - Each team member should not only make sure that she or he contributes, but should stand firm and not withhold, withdraw, or defer because of more aggressive team members

        - Participation goals are particularly important for members coming from underrepresented groups in engineering
          - Historically, it has been harder for these groups to get their input included and attended to

  - Leadership
    - Leadership facilitates team success, and every project requires a leader to reach successful completion
    - The most valuable things that a leader can do is to allow his or her team members to achieve the following objectives:
      - Make their contribution
        - Individuals are placed on a team for a reason and it's the leader's responsibility to see that those contributions are all realized

      - Realize their potential
        - A good leader will extract from the team members the best that they have to give

      - Achieve satisfaction
        - The leader will facilitate satisfaction in one's work
        - Satisfaction for engineers comes in large part from believing that their work is valued, enjoying their day-to-day activities, and seeing that their work has real-world results
    - The effective leader accomplishes these objectives by fulfilling a variety of roles:
      - Servant: the leader acts to meet the needs of the team, which are sometimes clearly stated, and other times need to be uncovered
      - Contractor: the leader enters into informal but binding covenants with his team members concerning their mutual work obligations, while the organization or company may make more formal employment contracts
      - Motivator: the critical area of team motivation falls mainly to the leader, although individual members may also contribute
      - Example: the good leader shows a willingness to undertake the tasks required of the entire team, including hardship and risk if necessary
      - Interpreter: the leader establishes context for what the team is undertaking, and to a great extent, defines reality in terms of the work environment, its requirements, its risks, and its potential reward
    - The Gal and Jones model describes "The Leader as Lens"
      - The model says that the leader provides an appraisal of the situation in terms of expectations, interpretations, and modes of presentation
      - The team reacts with physical, emotional, cognitive, and social responses
        - These responses determine how the team's effectiveness ranges from productive activity to destructive breakdown
      - Emphasizes the importance of the leader's appraisal and subsequent reappraisal
        - Much of the content of these appraisals is based on experience
  - Emotional Intelligence
    - Five main factors:
      - Self-Awareness
        - Ability to recognize and understand your own moods, emotions, and drives
        - Realistic self-assessment is generally associated with self-confidence, and often accompanied by a sense of humility and a self-deprecating sense of humor
        - A highly important aspect is understanding the effect you have on others
        - The objective is to have a positive and motivating effect
      - Self-Regulation
        - Ability to think before acting, and to control your impulses and emotions so that your actions are in accord with your intentions and with your ethical principles
        - Component of effective communication, particularly listening
        - Can become difficult during stressful situations, but is a critical part of leadership
          - A leader's emotions are contagious
        - Can be identified with accepting ambiguity and being open to change without major swings in mood or attitude
      - Motivation
        - Ability to impart projects with meaning and passion
        - The recognition that engineers, and particularly the newer generation of engineers, are motivated by factors beyond the traditional ones of money and status
      - Empathy
        - The capability to understand others' emotional makeup, and the ability to treat them accordingly
        - May involve an appropriate response to emotional difficulties team members are having due to personal as well as work factors
        - May also involve realizing that someone is having difficulties with social relationships within a team due to a deficiency in his or her ability to read other people's emotions
      - Socialization
        - Managing relationships within the team
        - Can include creating social networks, both inside and outside the team, finding common ground on the approach to problems, and building rapport among the team members
    - Dr. Daniel Goleman describes two types of interaction associated with emotional intelligence
      - An external interaction between you and others
      - The internal interactions among the factors
      - "High levels of emotional intelligence create climates in which information sharing, trust, risk-taking, and learning flourish. Low levels of emotional intelligence create climates rife with fear and anxiety."
    - The effective leader must realize that their immediate emotional state can also affect the team's performance
      - The leader needs to exercise self-awareness and self-regulation, particularly when circumstances are difficult, and if possible, present the situation in a realistically positive and hopeful way
  - Additional Factors
    - Team Orientation
      - Members must consider themselves part of a team, and not just as individuals performing tasks at the same time
      - Difficult to define, easy to recognize
    - Adaptability
      - Team must be able to adapt to changing circumstances, as projects rarely go according to plan
      - Flexibility and reacting quickly are a necessity
    - Motivation
      - Engineering teams need to be motivated, with every member sharing the desire to succeed
    - Trust
      - Can manifest both positively and negatively
      - Proper calibration of trust produces the best results
    - Feedback
      - Continual, honest, and accurate assessment of how the team is functioning is a fundamental necessity for correcting immediate problems and for improving long-term performance
      - Self-awareness on the team level
      - Assess each of the factors from earlier as important => process-oriented
    - Diversity
      - The opening of engineering education to a greater number of minority students ensures that today's and tomorrow's team members and leaders will be operating in a diverse environment
- Diversity and Engineering Teams
  - The current US society/workforce is more diverse than ever before in terms of minority representation
  - Positive Factors
    - The benefits of team diversity include the following:
      - Improved active thinking: promotes positive changes in active thinking processes, intellectual engagement and motivation, and learning skills
      - Improved critical thinking: diversity in work groups increases creativity, tolerance of ambiguity, and the ability to recognize flaws in potential actions
      - Improved management skills: managers who are effective with a diverse staff are more likely to succeed in a workforce driven by worldwide demographics

    - Diverse teams may approach the analysis and solution of problems from perspectives that homogeneous teams, even of exceptional individuals, may overlook

  - Academic Viewpoints
    - Stated objectives of the UCLA Diversity Committee:
      - Prepare engineering students to be effective as leaders in diverse working environments
      - Teach engineering students how best to use diversity in project teams
      - Show engineering instructors opportunities to encourage and promote diversity in courses
      - Encourage engineering students and instructors to promote diversity in school and at work

  - Diversity at a Major Engineering School
    - Recommendations:
      - Outreach focused on attracting lower income and women students to engineering at an early age
      - Recommendations for improved support services
      - Recommendations for improved diversity awareness
      - More project-oriented activities involving multiple ethnicities and random assignment to overcome ethnic grouping
      - Expanded criteria for admission that would not be so heavily focused on GPA and standardized tests
      - Increased financial aid, especially for international students

    - Conclusions:
      - Diversity climate was perceived to be reasonably fair and supportive
      - Future professionals saw significant room to improve
      - Students' responses were relatively uniform across categories, with some gender differences and greater ethnic differences
      - Students were "thinking like engineers"

  - Awareness of Bias
    - A major recurring problem is bias exhibited toward persons who are still minorities in engineering practice
    - Common forms of bias include:
      - Competency proving: minority groups repeatedly have to demonstrate that they are qualified for and capable of performing the jobs they are actually doing
      - Failure to differentiate: a member of a minority group is mistaken for another member of that group
        - Most pronounced for Euro-Americans when interacting with Asians or people of color

      - Sexual innuendo: a woman's normal request for work assistance or collaboration is taken as a romantic advance or a suggestion that she would like a date
      - Microaggression: a remark made without knowing that its implication is actually offensive or demeaning to the person receiving it

  - Microaggressions
    - This type of remark can wear someone down and cumulatively cause psychological distress
    - A form of harassment, even if not intended as such
    - The ability to recognize, understand, and avoid microaggressions requires a combination of social knowledge and personal empathy
    - Most of us harbor implicit biases, which may affect highly technical systems
    - Suggestion that organizations should adopt policies that make individuals' actions more dependent on objective criteria than on personal preferences

- Team Methodological Skills
  - Elements of Structured Decision Making
    - Main steps in methodological team problem-solving:
      - Establish a Process
        - Decide on the methodology, differentiate facts and assumptions, and recognize unknowns/act to address them
        - Starts with defining objectives, the final product, the time available, and the time distribution
          - Defining objects includes recognizing major issues, establishing requirements, dealing with prioritization, and outlining tasks to be accomplished

      - Analyze the Situation
        - Keep facts and assumptions separate by not allowing opinions to pass as facts and deal with uncertainties where they occur
        - Important not to pursue actions before agreeing on goals and constraints

      - Develop Alternative Courses of Action
        - Involves taking time to identify options and to discuss and analyze their relative merits, considering both benefits and costs or adverse consequences
        - Important not to focus too early on one strategy or to dismiss any alternatives prematurely

      - Make the Decision
        - Incorporates all of the above

- Summary
  - Ten commandments of team ethics:
    - Respect your teammates’ knowledge and expertise
    - Listen to and seriously consider teammates’ opinions
    - Share your knowledge and ideas openly and freely
    - Help others to achieve their potential
    - Acknowledge others’ accomplishments enthusiastically
    - Emphasize “We” instead of “You” or “I” in discussions
    - Defend (reasonably) the team when challenged
    - Benefit from diversity of teammates background and experience
    - Avoid discomforting or offending team member
    - Treat your teammates as you would want to be treated; do not treat them as you would not want to be treated.

  - Engineering is basically a team-based social activity because:
    - The complex societal problems it deals with depend on teamwork to solve
    - Engineering teamwork inexorably involves social and ethical factors

  - Team success depends on a combination of technical skills, interpersonal skills, and methodological skills
    - The interpersonal skillset includes communication, organization, leadership, team-building, coping, negotiation, and decision-making
    - Good leadership is essential for team success, and emotional intelligence is essential for good leadership

  - Interpersonal skills may govern our professional advancement





## Reading 5: Ethical Engineering Projects

- Introduction
  - Focus on what defines an engineering project, how teams are organized into projects, and how project management allows them to succeed
  - Can we establish a "bright-line" rule to differentiate ethical and unethical engineering projects?

- Project Description
  - Components
    - An engineering project is a technical activity with specific objectives
      - Can be early R&D, midcourse design and prototype design demonstration, or final system production, operation, and maintenance

    - Usually bounded in multiple dimensions:
      - Inputs are bounded with respect to requirements and constraints
      - Outputs are bounded with respect to deliverable products and/or data, services provided, and reports
      - Budgets generally bound the financial resources available, as well as the spending profile
      - Schedule establishes bounds for the beginning and for the end
      - Resource bounds determine the available personnel, facilities, and equipment

    - Projects are staffed with one or more teams of dedicated personnel representing varied disciplines: science and technology, management and administration, and support
    - Projects comprise a set of interrelated components, one of the most important of which is system requirements
      - Requirements come from a variety of sources and have multidimensional characteristics

    - Systems engineering is an essential area of project conceptualization and initial design, and generally accomplishes the following tasks:
      - System concept: defines the overall design and functions of the system being developed, designed, and/or manufactured
      - Subsystem definitions: complete the details of system concept
      - System modelling: includes the consideration of tradeoffs among technical and operational parameters
      - Modelling data: acquired by analysis, experimentation, or prior sources
      - Verification: uses the modelling data to show that all the requirements are achievable
      - Specification: quantify the requirements into actual system design factors

    - Projects are difficult for a variety of reasons
      - The problems for which a solution is desired may not be completely solvable
      - There may exist conflicting requirements and differing stakeholders' motivations
      - Modelling data may be incomplete, contradictory, or nonexistent
      - May be fundamental limitations of either technology or physics

  - Project Organization
    - We would likely organize the project as a combination of project subsystem teams and other functional elements
      - There would be engineering development teams associated with each of the subsystems, but there would also be a team for system engineering and a team for test facilities development/operation
      - There would be a management team comprising at minimum a project manager and assistant product manager
      - There would be a marketing team tasked with analyzing the potential market and helping define the product requirements and specification
      - There would be a number of support teams, including personnel concerned with project finances and control, with subcontracts to service or material suppliers, with purchasing of components and supplies, and with any legal issues that might arise

    - A work breakdown structure (WBS) would be established for the project
      - Accounting numbers would be assigned the project tasks and other cost categories so that expenditures could be tracked against the various project components

  - Project Phases
    - Project would likely move through several stages:
      - Planning: comprises system concept, requirements, specifications, feasibility analysis, documentation, total program cost estimates, and plans for preliminary design
      - Initial design: preliminary hardware and software design based on system concept, maybe including results of experiments, analyses, and studies, as well as verification of all specifications
        - May include revised project cost estimates

      - Prototype development: includes working design for hardware and software, prototyping and qualification, manufacturing plans, production cost estimates, and plans for final design
      - Production, delivery, and operations: includes final design, product manufacturing/assembly, installation, support, and maintenance

    - Completion of each phase is a major milestone

  - Management Tools
    - Completion of project tasks are planned and monitored by task schedules
    - Projects will generally have a means of tracking costs
      - Running above planned costs is always dangerous, as the project may exhaust its funds before completion
      - Running below planned costs may be a good thing, but it could also be an indication that tasks are not being adequately staffed, that the work itself is falling behind schedule, or that the cost estimate was flawed to begin with
      - Management should try to determine the cause of differences between planned and actual costs

    - The project would then go through a number of review cycles:
      - Peer Reviews
        - Occur on a day-to-day basis among project team members and leaders
        - The primary forum where progress is assessed and problems get identified/solved

      - Management Reviews
        - Occur on a periodic basis as determined by the pace of the project and the managers'/organization's procedures

      - Periodic Stakeholder Reviews
        - May occur at set intervals
        - Generally include representatives of all key groups and occupy a day or more of presentations

      - Major Milestone Reviews
        - Held when major milestones are achieved
        - Includes all major contributors and stakeholders, and may take longer than periodic stakeholder reviews, as this is where critical project decisions are discussed and determined

  - High-Level Questions
    - Is management an end in itself or a means to an end?
      - Nobody does project management for its own sake
      - It's always done in the service of achieving a successful end product

    - Does project management stifle creativity or free technical expression?
      - Management can be both stifling and freeing
      - There are frequently good engineering ideas during a project that will constitute changes in design and affect requirements, specifications, cost, and schedule
        - If they are not caught and deterred early, they may result in a product that completely misses the intended target
        - Often necessary for management to delay the implementation of the idea
        - Sometimes the idea is too good to neglect, and it's the duty of the management to justify the change of course

    - Is project management boring or stimulating?
      - Depends entirely on the person

- The Bright Line Criteria
  - How do we separate ethical projects from unethical projects?

  - The criteria for punitive damages can be summarized as follows:
    - Malicious: there is prior knowledge of the injurious effects, and perhaps even harmful intent
    - Fraudulent: there is false representation of the product, generally that it is safe rather than dangerous, often with concurrent suppression of the true facts, such as intern results and reports
    - Oppressive: the company or organization is able to impose its power to deny the public its basic rights to knowledge and safety

- Ethical Ambiguity
  - In many cases, the situation may introduce ethical ambiguity
  - Suppression and Misdirection
    - The nuclear disaster of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Okuma, Japan

  - Negligence, Procrastination, and Greed
    - Amtrak incident between Seattle and Portland
    - The Camp Fire in Paradise, CA

- The Bright Zone
  - The complexity of most engineering projects makes it difficult to apply a single criterion or a set of criteria to determine their ethical nature/assign responsibility for unethical portions
  - Ethical analysis must trace, in detail, the network of project participants, their tasks, their influence, and the results of their actions
  - The separation of ethical from unethical projects can be thought of as a "bright zone", where careful, case-by-case consideration of issues and values is necessary before a final determination can be made
    - This is the philosophy of Pragmatism applied in the area of projects




## Reading 6: The Process of Industrialization

- Introduction
  - If we understand how technology and society have interacted in the past, we gain a framework of understanding that allows us to put current issues into context and better understand their societal implications
    - It's essential to know how we got here in order to recognize where we are now and where we're going

  - There were some periods in the past that were exemplary from the standpoint of society's relationship to technology, and remembering them might help us introduce the good parts again

- Egypt and Mesopotamia: Technology – Small and Large
  - Historians have observed that technology evolves in complexity, adaptation, specialization, and persistence
    - Items that were available in the past remain available now and process that people used in the past remain available now

  - Middle Eastern regions show us village technology raised to a higher level by "industrial" processes such as metal smelting, pottery firing, and glass making
  - In Egypt and Mesopotamia, technology included the following segments:
    - Animals: used for power, food, and clothing
    - Agriculture: both family and communal farming
    - Cloth: spinning to create thread from fibers and weaving to create cloth from thread
    - Communications: writings, pictures, and models for record keeping and communication as well as part of religious practice
    - Fire: for heating, cooking, and industrial shop work
    - Iron and other metals: for weapons as well as for tools and utensils
    - Pottery: hand-formed or spun on a wheel with glazing and firing for holding liquids
    - Glass: ornamental as beads and amulets and later functional in the form of small bottles for perfume and other essences
    - Structures: houses, buildings, and monuments made of wood, brick, and stone
    - Wheels: used for transport and also for engines of warfare
    - Water conduits: in the form of canals providing for irrigation, drinking, and disposal of sewage

  - "Agriculture was the basis of the economy, home was the center of most production, and the main source of power was man or beast"
  - Region also produced technology on a grand scale: the Pyramids of Giza
    - Remain a tribute to grand visions and building to last, as well as prototypes for the Greek/Roman architectures to follow


- Ancient Greece: Classical with Instruments
  - Ancient Greece and Rome established the models upon which the societies of Europe and the New World were built
  - In addition to excellent stonework, the Greeks were also highly proficient in the creation of fine instruments from metal
  - Greek technology of mechanisms and instruments shows a surprising amount of science and precision
    - Some used for civil engineering and warfare
    - Mostly used for academic study and demonstration of phenomenon
      - Ex) Astrolabe to illustrate the observed movements of heavenly bodies, Antikythera mechanism used as a calendar computer
- Roman Empire: Template for European Civilization
  - Technology was an indispensable part of Rome's widespread empire
  - Technology Highlights
    - Less about sophisticated instruments in support of science/teaching, and more about straightforward, highly practical mechanisms and methodologies for civil engineering/transportation/warfare
    - Major aspects of Roman technology included:
      - Power transmission: Roman improvements included heavy-duty gearing as part of large mechanisms, screws and screw drives, and force pumps and their applications
      - Concrete: Romans excelled at building with concrete (arches, vaults, domes, docks, sea walls, bridges, etc.)
      - Aqueducts: Romans built elevated aqueducts to bring water from the mountains, where it was available, to the cities and towns where it was needed
      - Roads and stairs: Romans' many-layered roads and their marble stairs
      - Glass: sophisticated glass bottles and other objects used for personal, home, and business use
      - Ships: shipbuilding technology focused on war, using both rowers and sails for propulsion; designed to sail close to shore and often include a bronze ram to disable enemy ships
      - Weapons: military technology added more sophisticated armor and standoff weapons to the arsenal of the individual soldier, aided by advanced tactics
      - City planning: the Romans had a template for cities, which they applied throughout their extensive empire
  - Technology of Daily Life
    - The Romans were similar to us in their personalities, their interests, and in how they conducted their daily lives
    - Two types of construction that exemplify Roman architecture are the Roman Coliseum and the Roman aqueducts
    - "All roads lead to Rome"
      - Attests to the important of Roman roads to their empire
      - Roads built to last
  - Empire and Organization
    - Roman organization gave us the template for subsequent European society, both for its cities and for the integrated state
    - The Roman model included the following:
      - Consistency: Roman city plans were similar throughout the Empire
      - Infrastructure: Cities provided for housing at several economic levels, for commerce, entertainment, sports, recreation, and eduction, while also providing water distribution and sewage disposal
      - Governance: cities included public buildings where functions of government were carried out, including politics and courts of justice
    - With respect to the integrated state, we see:
      - Politics and the military: centrally coordinated from Rome and widely applied throughout the empire
        - Remote governors and commanders often returned to Rome to prestigious positions or retirement
        - Public argumentation and political orations were a regular part of Roman life
      - Transportation: Roman armies, supplies, and trade goods moved by land over the well-constructed road and by sea in Roman vessels
      - Communication: messages were sent to remote outposts primarily over the roads networks, but also on occasion by signals
        - Exchange was surprisingly fast, sent letters could be received within weeks
      - Social stratification: Roman society was much like our own
        - Slavery was not based on race, but was a result of conquest
        - Slaves could become free by will of their master, or by buying their freedom
        - Slaves could even become Roman citizens
      - Common culture: spread both coercively and voluntarily
- Meanwhile in China: Starting Ahead of the West
  - Some of the earliest Chinese innovations were in agriculture
    - Ex) Seed drill, row cultivation, extensive hoeing, chain pump, etc.
  - Chinese industrial materials and processes were particularly advanced and included:
    - Paper: used for writing, clothing, and armor
    - Blast furnace: a means of creating a hotter smelting oven by pumping in extra oxygen, and is necessary for making steel
    - Printing: printing with movable type
    - Gunpowder: manufactured and used for fireworks, a starter for Greek fire, and an early version of a gun
    - Compass: pioneering use of magnetic material to make compasses for navigation
  -  Two significant Chinese achievements in construction were the suspension bridge and the walls of China
    - The wall was designed to keep people out, but had the unintended consequence of corralling Chinese ideas and innovations
- Medieval Europe: The Not So Dark Ages
  - The lights of philosophical and scientific inquiry seem to have gone out, but several important innovations appeared during this time
    - Ex) The heavy plow creating agricultural surplus, leading to accumulation of funds, more efficient/effective use of horsepower, "stand-off" weapons
  - Most important innovatins:
    - Paper: provided an inexpensive product that could replace costly parchment for the dissemination of written material
    - Arabic numbers: provided a much more effective means of calculation than Roman numerals
    - Blast furnace: set the stage for industrial production of steel and other metals
- The Renaissance: Progress and the Personal Ideal
  - Called the Renaissance due to the rediscovery of Greek and Roman scientific and philosophical knowledge that had been suppressed by the Church
  - Mechanical Clock
    - Brings a new degree of precision to create events in time
    - Followed up by the spring watch, which was portable and improved navigation
    - Ushered in a new era of scientific experimentation, industrial productivity, efficiency measurement, and personal time management
  - Printing
    - Introduction of moveable time, metal molds, and oil-based ink
    - Written material was previously produced by hand, and was previously only affordable by the rich
    - Made possible the broad dissemination of scientific and technical information
    - Began universal sharing of scientific and technical knowledge, creating new vectors and distributions of great power
  - The template for the modern Renaissance person:
    - Individualism
    - Versatility
    - Technology, science, and art
    - Publication and discussion

- The Enlightenment: Foundation of the Industrial Revolution

  - Laid the foundation for the Industrial Revolution that followed
  - Birth of the idea that human history was not just as stated by the Biblical book of Ecclesiastes
    - Book detailed an essentially meaningless succession of cycles
    - Alternative was that there is meaning, and societal progress is a way of realizing that meaning
    - Growing realization that there was a universal understanding of morals and human rights analogous to European philosophies
  - Deism
    - Separated God's ethical teachings from nature and natural laws
    - Believed that nature's laws are public, not private and inscrutable and that governance should be by agreement among people, not by divine law
    - Not only influenced European thought in science and philosophy, but were also embraced by many founding fathers of the US
      - Essential base of American democracy
  - Formal Mathematical Structure
    - Descartes made a connection between algebra and geometry
    - Newton developed the laws of motion and the mathematical basis of modern physics
    - Leibniz invented differential and integral calculus
  - Experimentation and Demonstration
    - Galileo confirmed Copernicus' sun-centric theory
    - Hooke first reported on cells using the microscope
    - Boyle provided the laws of gases
  - Society shifted from an evolutionary form of technical advance to a new environment of inventions and contributions, where technology advanced rapidly in large and well-documented leaps and bounds

- The Industrial Revolution: Society Transforms

  - The revolutionary change in Western society from primarily agrarian with technical support to primarily industrial with agrarian support
  - The Steam Engine
    - Initiated the revolution
    - Provided a newly portable power source and illustrates two main features of the period:
      - The use of science and prior demonstrations (gas laws) to create a totally new device
      - The fact that the first instantiation is not the one that dominates/is most remembered
    - Early use was the operate chain pumps, but was later expanded to trains, vehicles, ships, and factories
  - Interchangeable Parts
    - Idea is to avoid the requirement of individual crafting by skilled technicians and promoting assembly by unskilled workers
  - The Most Powerful Idea in the World
    - Idea of the patent as the most powerful contribution of the industrial revolution
    - Patents opened the field of technical innovation to engineers and mechanics who were not part of the aristocracy that manned the scientific councils of the day
      - Offered inventors protection for their innovative concepts and assured they could benefit financially from their inventions
    - From an ethical perspective, the introduction of patents had some novel effects:
      - New rights: included the right to ownership of "intellectual property" by an everyman as well as an aristocrat, and the right to exploit such property for personal as well as societal benefit
      - New duties: included a respect for patents and the protections they offered, an ethical as well as a legal obligation not to violate a patent, the duty to make ethical use of inventions and to promulgate the knowledge contained in the patent
      - Other consequences: not always positive for society because patents allowed individuals and companies to assert control of entire industries
        - Promoted a concentration of power by the new aristocracy of industrialists
        - The resulting power may have assisted in the colonization of the nonindustrial world by the industrialized countries
  - Lighter than Air Flight: A Dream Realized
    - Use of lighter-than-air balloons
    - Put to practical and recreational use around the world, including as an observational balloon on the Union side in the Civil War
  - Changing the World
    - Steam engines are applied to steam railways and carriages, river and ocean ships, farm harvesters, cotton gins, as well as factories of all kinds
    - Electricity moves from a scientific curiosity to practical use in a variety of applications
    - Personal transportation is revolutionized by the bicycle and the automobile, and communication becomes almost instantaneous, expands to photography and moving pictures, and, at the end of the century, to the beginnings of radio
    - Had societal counter-reactions
  - Telegraphic Communication
    - Scientists and engineers quickly began working with the new energy of electricity to find ways to store it in batteries (called voltaic cells) and send it over wires
    - Logical leap was to turn the transmitted energy into signals => the initial telegraph system
  - A Decade of Engineering Achievements
    - Project of laying the telegraph cable across the Atlantic was completed, connecting the old world with the new with instantaneous communication
    - A railroad connecting the continental US was completed with the work of numerous laborers
    - The Suez Canal was completed, and the combination of European engineering and local labor connected shipping East to West through a much shorter route
  - High Fidelity History: Light and Sound Recording
    - The practical application of photography in the field as well as the studio by many photographers
    - The introduction of sound recording
    - The initial extension of still photographs to moving pictures
    - For the first time, society had access to accurate records of things as they were and of things as they used to be
  - Individually Powered Transport
    - First automobiles were created when engineers put together electric batteries with electric motors on chasses
    - Patent for a gas engine changed how power was supplied to the vehicle, causing gas-powered cars to overtake the electric models
      - More efficiency by weight
  - Pedal-Powered Transport
    - New industrial materials allowed relatively lightweight bicycles to be constructed
    - Give average people new mobility, allowing them to travel sizable distances on their own
    - New widespread demand for more and better roads and for new bikeways
    - Afforded housewives the opportunity to be more than housewives
  - End Notes
    - Two more notable innovations:
      - The beginning of distribution systems that would bring electricity to the rural area as well as cities
      - The initial demonstration of radio signal transmission
    - Technical decision between AC and DC

- Ethical Reactions: Societal and Individual

  - Society's spokespersons and members reacted strongly to the significant changes of the Industrial Revolution
  - Visions of the Future
    - We separate literary visions of the future into utopias and dystopias
    - Two particularly interesting utopias are:
      - *Erewhon, or Over the Range*
        - Traveler discovers a country in which machines have been banished
        - People are generally happy, but at the expense of the machine society being built
      - *Looking Backward*
        - Protagonist looks backward from the vantage point of an ideal socialist society where people share equally in the rewards of technology
    - Three particularly interesting dystopias are:
      - *Gulliver's Travels*
        - Emphasis on the idea that the new focus on science is mostly useless
        - Comes from an author with a dyspeptic view of humanity in general
      - *Looking Further Backward*
        - Published as an answer to *Looking Backward*
        - Described how Chine invaded the US, which had been weakened by socialism, to restore a capitalistic society
      - *When the Sleeper Wakes*
        - Describes how a person sleeping for 200 years wakes in London, where people are dominated by propaganda and ruled by a demagogue
    - Several of these old dystopias have clear reflections in today's economic and political environments
  - Objections to the Technology's Effects
    - Three types of societal objection:
      - Luddism: workers fighting for the right to work against displacement by machine automation
      - John Henryism: workers fight for the right of personhood against dehumanization by machine
      - Restorationism: groups promote the value of previous, more human-centered historical periods against an industrialized society

- Summary

  - Industrialization gave society the following items:

    - | Category                 | Examples                                                  |

## Reading 7: Building the Information Age

- Introduction
  - 20th century marked the establishment of a "modern" society and the realization of the power of the science-based technology
  - Began with society in a symbiotic relationship with technology, ends with society having to apply life-and-death moral and ethical reasoning
  - Leaves some serious long-standing social problems unsolved
- Technical Innovation and Integration
  - Most startling was the demonstration of heavier-than-air flight by Orville and Wright
    - Lift-producing wings and three-axis control system
    - Built on their work with bicycles, motors, and printing machinery
    - Showed the world the power of homegrown innovation

  - Skyscrapers exemplified the novel integration of 19th century technology using the following technologies:
    - Telephone: permitted voice communication between city offices
    - Typewriter: empowered secretaries and turned offices into independent print shops
    - Elevator: the beautifully names mechanism that could safely life office-goers to great heights
    - Air conditioning: made comfortable large spaces filled with people and machines
    - Plate glass: improved manufacturing
    - Steel bridge: framework allowed a building to achieve great height without the need for very thick walls

  - The ascendance of the skyscraper coincided with the start of the century
- Mass Production and Society Effects
  - The Ford Motor Company provided an example of both integration and innovation
    - The 1908 Model T had some notable improvements:
      - Standardized: the Model T was the only car that Ford built
      - Simplified: one color
      - Improvable: the Ford Company initiated an R&D arm to bring Model T refinements
      - Affordable: Henry Ford was able to bring the price of the Model T well within reach of customers

    - Also introduced a number of key innovations:
      - Moving chassis assembly line: cars moved past assembly stations where one or two workers performed one of 84 assembly steps, reducing the time it took to construct a car by 88%
      - $5 per day wage: doubled the daily wage of factory workers by adding a morality bonus, earnable by upright Christian families

    - Henry Ford was motivated to create a "consumer class" that would be customers for both his cars and for other products of mass production factories
      - Mass production at Ford led to a rigid mechanization of workers' jobs by the method of "time and motion engineering"
      - Since their job was to make the assembly line/production process move faster, time and motion engineers were disliked by factory workers
      - Benefitted from "the separation of thinking from doing"
      - Mass production principles soon transcended cars and permeated the general industrial economy
        - Provided an increased flow of consumer goods of reasonable quality and affordable at almost every income level
        - Created new channels of distribution and marketing + a new stratification of society
        - Advertising went from local to national

  - Industrial society divided into capital (the owners of the enterprises) and labor (those who worked for them)
    - Labor divided into white collar and blue collar
    - Workers organized into unions to gain bargaining power, which was vehemently opposed by factory owners

  - The historically frugal American character was being rewired for "aspirational consumerism"
- Futurism and Modernity
  - Period called the period of futurism and modernity because of the symbiotic relationship between technology and society
    - Futurism is a philosophy that appreciated the radical nature of technological change and predicted that the newly introduced technologies would contribute to modernizing all aspects of society
    - Futurists recognized the great changes the world was undergoing due to the acceleration of technical progress and rejected classical beauty while embodying a love of speed and danger

  - Modern Design Stages
    - Early 20th century design can be separated into 3 stages:
      - Art Nouveau: variation on the rococo ornamental styles of the 19th century and featured the introduction of new organic forms and structures to architecture/art/jewelry
      - Art Deco: simplified and extracted the Art Nouveau decorative forms, introducing new motifs such as Egyptian, African, and American Indian
      - Streamline Moderne: a further distillation of Art Deco design, with more reflection to contemporary machines and materials

    - Together, these are referred to as the Machine Age

  - New Ways of Building
    - Modern style was incorporated into world architecture

  - New Consumer Products
    - Modern design strongly affected the products for sale to both average consumers and the wealthy
      - Cars began moving from economy to style

  - Society Connects: Radio, Movies, and Air Transport
    - Spreading electrification of the country allowed 70% of households to receive radio by 1935
      - Radio became the focal point for family gathering
      - Broadcast radio and newly emerging movies promoted a uniquely American way of life
        - Served to give the public something to admire and live up to

    - Equally rapid growth of the air transport industry brought people together physically
      - Driven by airships until the Hindenburg disaster

  - A Depressing Interlude
    - The Great Depression affected America and the rest of the world for the next decade
    - FDR's New Deal fought unemployment with a variety of stimulus programs which contributed to the country's technological and physical infrastructure
      - Largest program was the Works Progress Administration, which conducted projects like the Tennessee Valley Authority
      - Another program was the Civilian Conservation Corp

  - Real Skyscrapers
    - Technical progress continued through the Great Depression and skyscrapers bloomed in NYC

  - Bauhaus Design
    - "Form follows function"
    - Used industrial materials as much as possible to allow for widespread distribution at a reasonable cost

  - A Streamlined World
    - Introduced the idea of streamlining to other applications
    - Ex) Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion house and Dymaxion car
- Futurism Peaks: The 1939 New York's World Fair
  - Long series of world industrial exhibitions and fairs
  - Attempted to project the positive effects of society's rapidly developing technologies
  - Highlight was the technology, which were called the tools with which people would build the future
  - Called the peak of futurism, as it would be followed by the start of WWII, which showed people the destructive power of new technologies
- World War II and Ethical Consequences
  - Mobilization
    - US had a tremendous industrial capacity, which remained protected by distance throughout the war
    - America mobilized completely for the war effort and almost our entire industrial capacity was converted to production of military equipment and material

  - Military Technology
    - Continuation of technology introduced in WWI
    - Included the following:
      - Small arms: improvements to weapons like rifles and hand grenades and extensions to flamethrowers and anti-tank bazookas
      - Armor and transport: the battle tank and long-range artillery were made more effective and heavy-duty armored trucks provided mass transport
      - Aircraft: major advances in heavy bombers, fighter aircraft, and ground support aircraft, as well as the introduction of the jet engine
      - Anti-aircraft guns: weapons designed to counter the improvements in aircraft
      - Ships: submarines, battleships, and destroyers all increased in range and power and large aircraft carriers proved important the battles in the Pacific theater
      - Concentration and extermination camps: both sides used concentration camps to confine groups considered threatening

    - Genocide began as a weapon of war in WWI and was turned into a state-sponsored technology by Nazi Germany
    - Revolutionary weaponry included:
      - Electronics: new capabilities were introduced in the form of radar and electronic bombsights
      - Computation: advances in electronic computation were adapted to the field of cryptography
        - Breaking the German code introduced an ethical dilemma: should known targets be warned in advance even though that would reveal that the Germans' code had been broken?
        - Allies proceeded in utilitarian manner: most good for the most people meant the secret had to be kept at the expense of some lives

      - Weapons of mass destruction: saturation and incendiary bombing of cities, use of long-range ballistic and semi-guided missiles, and the Atomic Bomb

  - The Atomic Bomb
    - Once the atomic bomb was developed, the question became whether or not to use it to end the war with Japan
    - Utilitarian choice: if the detonation of the bomb could force a surrender, then more lives could be saved than in a traditional fight
    - Bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, ending the war => likely the most significant moral and ethical decision of the 20th century
      - Unintentionally resulted in a proliferation of atomic weapons in an attempt to ensure countries could all have this advantage
      - Inequitable distribution of happiness
      - Continued into the Cold War and resulted in the MAD standoff

    - Was the action fundamentally wrong?
      - Some argued that the estimates of conventional deaths and injuries were inflated or that Japan would have surrendered soon because of the entrance of the Soviet Union
      - Most would stand by the decision and cite the movement of Japan to a democracy and friend of the US as a beneficial consequence

  - The Aftermath
    - The US set about helping the defeated countries after the war and was remarkably successful in restoring the world
    - The postwar world could reflect on the lessons of WWII:
      - Technology is ecumenical, it can be used to support dictators, totalitarianism, racism, and purposes of pure evil as well as democracy and traditional ethical ideals
      - Science-based weapons and their production are key factors in modern warfare and will continue to be in the future
      - Society has achieved the technical capability for planetwide destruction, not only of humanity, but of other species as well, conceivably of all life on Earth
      - Worldwide cooperation is necessary if society is to survive and prosper in some degree of peace

    - The UN was formed to promote worldwide cooperation
      - One of the first actions they took was to consider the question of human rights in the aftermath of the war
      - They adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948
        - Illustrates the great influence the American example had on the world's ethical consciousness

    - Society had seen the dark side of technology along with its bright side, and would proceed with caution when continuing
- The Expansive 1950s
  - At WWII's end, the US entered into a decade of expansion and consumption
    - The US was the leader of the free world and the dominant technical and economic power

  - Infrastructural Changes
    - New suburbs were being created outside the central cities in the form of tracts of small, nearly-identical homes
    - Freeway systems surrounding the central cities and supporting the suburbs were being built around the country
    - LA moved away from a very efficient area-wide mass transit system based on streetcars to a new system that was based on personal transport by car
      - Many other cities were undergoing the same change
      - For convenience and the image of prestige
      - Streets became too crowded for streetcars and they were retired

  - Everybody Watching
    - Commercial TV began appearing in American households by 1948/49
      - Captivating and rapidly began to replace radios as the center of family activity
      - Audiences grasped its importance as a public forum with the televising of political conventions, commentary, and daily news
      - Also provided free entertainment for all
      - Became an advertisers' paradise once they realized the persuasive power it held

    - Kathy Fiscus well incident emphasized the drama of the newly interconnected visual world
      - Incident vividly demonstrated the power of real-time, real-life dramas with everybody seeing the same thing at the same time
      - Became the template for live news coverage and helped establish the TV set as the new focus of societal life

  - Technical Milestones
    - IBM 701 computer introduced in 1952
      - First fully electronic model
      - Ability to read and write on magnetic tape
      - Still relied almost entirely on punched cards for input and output
      - IBM had underestimated the market for these computers and the 700 series became the mainstay computer of numerous universities, agencies, and corporations
      - Marked the arrival of the computer age

    - Soviet Union launched Sputnik I in 1957
      - US funded their space program slowly, unlike the Soviets who pushed theirs aggressively
      - "Wake up call" for America resulting in more funding for our space program and increased emphasis on science and mathematics in K-12 programs
        - When tax money decreased, schools dropped other important programs like vocational education
        - Increase in high school dropout and a lack of skilled technicians

  - Modernism Evolves
    - By the 50s, modern architecture had settled in the Bauhaus-inspired "international style"
      - Called for no decoration or embellishment, just a geometric structure with unrelieved glass walls

    - One initiative that received traction was the All Electric Kitchen of the Future
      - Promoted the electric appliances that consumers were generally ready to buy
      - Saved labor
      - Attempted to give American women something meaningful to do while staying home and raising the "baby boom" generation
        - Hardly fulfilling, so women gradually began to return to the workforce

  - Auto Exuberance
    - Car industry went into high gear to supply pent-up demand
    - Machines reflected the exuberance of the times
      - Impractical, gas-guzzling, loaded with chrome, and often sported rocket fins

  - Futurism Lite
    - Futurist visions displayed by The Jetsons

- The Turbulent 1960s
  - Civil Rights Revolution
    - US remained a segregated country throughout the 50s, despite an executive order ending segregation in the military and the *Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka* Supreme Court decision
      - Most noticeable in the South, but existed in northern cities as well

    - Societal phenomenon called "the revolution of rising expectations" where a suppressed population doesn't revolt until its suppression is partially relieved
    - Mostly nonviolent
    - Influenced the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which made racial discrimination illegal and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 which prohibited racial discrimination in voting

  - Reaction by Assassination
    - JFK was assassinated in 1963 for unknown reasons
    - Malcolm X was assassinated in 1965 by his own men for softening his black isolationist philosophy
    - Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968 by a white segregationist
    - Robert Kennedy was assassinated in 1968 while campaigning for the presidency by a Palestinian who opposed his political positions

  - Other Protest Movements
    - Civil Rights Movement was ongoing and escalated into numerous city riots
      - Perhaps because of the victories of the civil rights acts

    - Free Speech Movement began at UC Berkeley with the objective of giving students a greater voice in the affairs of their university
      - Spread throughout other universities and aligned itself with the Civil Rights Movement and the Anti-Vietnam War Movement

    - The Anti-Vietnam War movement was the result of America's unsuccessful involvement in the Vietnam Civil War
      - Department of Defense restarted the draft that weight disproportionately on poorer youth
      - Continual escalation with increasing American deaths and injuries powered the movement
      - Both moral and pragmatic objectives
        - This fight is not ours and not right
        - End the conflict to cut our losses

      - 1968 Democratic National Convention brought anti-war proponents into direct conflict with local police and National Guard Troops
      - Came to a head in 1970 at Kent State University, where the National Guard opened fire on a crowd of protesting students, killing 4
        - Repeated at Jackson State University, where 2 students were killed
        - Brought national opinion on the side of the protests, causing President Nixon to end the war in 1973
        - America's power axis tipped away from the establishment and towards the people

- Technology's Societal Effects
  - Reactions
    - Turmoil of the 60s included societal reactions to the continued expansion of industries and the myriad of technical innovations at the time
    - In 1962, Rachel Carson published *Silent Spring*, which discussed the effects of natural ecosystems of the chemical pollutants being released from factories into adjacent waterways
      - Galvanized the country and was the beginning of environmental activism

    - In 1965, Ralph Nader published *Unsafe at any Speed*, which accused Detroit of turning out cars that were unsafe and unreliable
      - Accused car industry executives and engineers of culpability in an increasingly large number of car accidents
      - Began consumer activism

    - In 1967, Marshall McLuhan published *The Medium is the Message*, saying that the medium of television conveyed a message aside from its program content
      - Said that technology would soon lead to "The Global Village" of complete worldwide connectivity

    - In 1968, Joe McInnis published *The Selling of the President*
      - Focused on the debate between John Kennedy and Richard Nixon, where Nixon was an experience politician, but appeared badly on TV, while John Kennedy was the opposite
      - TV was a critical factor and politicians would be packaged like other advertised goods

  - Technical Dominance
    - At the end of the 60s, the US caught up to and surpassed the Soviet Union in space
      - Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were the first to walk on the moon

    - Subtle shift in dominance away from the historically industrialized countries, including the US
      - Ex) The car industry shifting in favor of Japan

    - Switch to a new system called lean production:
      - Met customer needs and desires
        - As opposed to the US attitude of "if you build it, they will buy it"

      - The factory was treated as a total system, not a set of loosely connected activity centers
        - Optimized manufacturing

      - Emphasis on automation and robots, the next steps after mechanization
      - Coordinated the supply chain, introducing "just in time" parts instead of storing parts in large inventories
        - Decrease in costs and increase in flexibility

      - Statistical quality control was used to identify, trace, and correct defects
      - Bridged the labor-management gap, causing workers to feel free to offer suggestions

    - Japanese experience demonstrated that formerly less-developed countries were not ready to be industrialized at a high level and to provide skilled labor at lower costs than in the US
      - American product manufacture began to be outsourced to low-wage foreign factories and lower-priced foreign products were imported to compete with American products
      - Eroded the power of American unions and factory jobs in the US became lower paid, with fewer benefits and less security

  - Personal Computing and Communications
    - Advances in the 70s moved the main locus of computing from large centralized main frames and smaller sized mini computers to the individual desktop
      - First in business offices and research centers, and then in homes
      - The IBM PC was a revelation to society in the capability it put into the hands of its users
        - Lacked a friendly UI, which was supplied by the Apple line of personal computers, which borrowed from innovations at Xerox PARC to create a new level of interaction

      - Made the computer a consumer product and divided society into the "computer savvy" and the not
      - Began to bring the rapidly expanding Internet to the world at large

    - Equivalent revolution occurring in personal telephone communications
      - First phone call made on a handheld cellular phone in 1973
      - Motorola offered consumers the DynaTAC 8000X mobile phone in 1983
      - Ushered in a new era of convenient telephone communication
        - Within a few years, they would integrate with personal microcomputers to become smartphones, leading to a leap forward in societal connectivity

  - Anxiety and Overload
    - By the late 70s, social commentators had seen enough of the new Information Age to become worried about its effects
      - Examined the societal and personal implications of the information revolution, characterized by rapid change and extensive data sources, and considered what could be done to transition into the future world

    - In 1979, Alvin Toffler published *Future Shock*, which focused on the rapid changes associated with the new computer society:
      - Keeping up: how to stay with the accelerating pace of life
      - Transience: evolution into a throwaway society in terms of products and people
      - Diversity: too many products, subcultures, and lifestyles => the "tyranny of choice"
      - Adaptability: would there be psychological and physical effects?
      - Survival: asked if people would have to develop new coping skills, if education for tomorrow would have to take new forms, and if society should invest effort in taming technology

    - In 1989, Richard Saul Wurman published *Information Anxiety*, where he recognizes that the personal computer has made a great amount of information available to everybody, but has worries
      - The Noninformation Explosion: we're inundated with facts, but starved for information

- Postmodernism
  - 80s and 90s were a period of technical harvesting
  - The Cold War Ends
    - In the 80s, mismanagement and overspending by totalitarian leaders caused the Soviet Union to implode
      - Upon its formal dissolution in 1991, the Cold War was ended

    - Afterwards, the US established friendly relations with Russia and other constituent countries
    - Following Nixon's 1972 visit to China, trade relations with China improved
    - A war in 1990 started by Iraq against Kuwait was put down by our intervention
    - America found itself without any serious or substantial enemies

  - Postmodern Design
    - In 1984, Phillip Johnson threw the architecture and design world into a spin with the AT&T headquarters in NY
      - Broke the dominant international style
      - Helped legitimize the postmodern movement
      - Other buildings that followed this example included the Portland Building, the Disney Concert Hall, and the Jewish Museum

- Summarizing 20th Century Technology and Influences
  - The 20th century was a period of accelerating technological change
    - The acceptance of new technical products became progressively faster

  - Society built new frameworks of reference for technical knowledge
    - Major framework was initially electrical and automotive, but became informational
    - Learned to balance its expectations of technology's benefits and costs

  - Long-standing societal problems persisted in the 20th century
    - Increasingly deadly war and destruction driven by technological innovation
    - Saw no valid technical solutions to poverty and homelessness

  - Negative reactions to technology included:
    - Anti-scientism: a reaction against the principles of the Enlightenment and rejects the idea that reason and science are contributing to the progressive betterment of mankind
    - Anti-technology: characterization of technology as malign, creating more problems than it solves
    - Media bias: overly selective focus on bad news and pending catastrophes neglect current positive aspects and reinforced the "malign technology" idea
    - Disproportionism: differing estimates of societal vs. individual well-being, as individuals felt they were being displaced and overlooked as the US moved manufacturing jobs overseas
    - Agnotologistics: dealt with the societal dissemination of ignorance and false controversies

- The Road Ahead
  - The most insidious reaction at the end of the 20th century was the beginning of "the war on truth"
    - The substitution of opinions for facts, revelation over observation

  - The disillusion with science and technology also sparked many dystopias, with no contradicting utopias
    - "Dystopia used to be a fiction of resistance; it's become a fiction of submission, helplessness, and hopelessness"

  - Argument that statistically, the better angels of our nature have been conquering our inner demons for centuries, largely as a result of reason, science, and knowledge
    - Supported by point that disease, crime, discrimination, and most forms of pollution are in long-term decline, while longevity and education keep rising and economic indicators are better than in any past generation




## Reading 8: Ethics of Population and Resources

- World Population: History, Factors, and Projections
  - The rapid increase in the world's population during the last centuries underlies many of the problems we face in the 21st century
    - When we plot the world's population on a long historical scale, the growth of population appears as a spike

  - Three major eras have contributed to world population growth:
    - Toolmaking, which gave us the implements to seriously affect our environment and livelihood
    - Agricultural, in which major associated population growth factors included the change from nomadic hunting and gathering to stable village living, with the domestication of animals and regular food production
      - Enabled the world to feed its mainly rural population consistently, and began to create substantial food surpluses in the more technically advanced areas

    - Industrialization radically transformed the world's technology and economy
      - Urbanization improved shelter and transport, provided water and energy, and initiated sanitation and health services
      - Health science and technology fought infection through cleanliness and antibiotics, provided hospitalization including isolation and intensive care, created new medication including inoculation and aggressive treatment, brought new understanding of nutrition, and contributed to longevity primarily through improved survival of infants and young adults

  - Industrialization contributed significantly to increasing family resources
    - Before, local populations were caught in the Malthusian Trap, where technological advances increased local population, which then overran the available resources, keeping the standard of living the same

  - Industrial Revolution significantly improved productivity and initiated great financial growth worldwide
    - Related benefits weren't evenly spread, but did extend to families via jobs and products and improved trade

  - Whether a defined population grows, remains steady, or shrinks is determined by a factor called the fertility rate, which is the average number of children per woman
    - Last 70 years have seen major changes in fertility rates, with the fertility rates of heavily industrialized nations dropping
    - There is no longer any economic value to large families
      - There are actually disincentives now, as urbanization raises the cost of housing for large families, costly education is the route to advancement for a family's children, and the potential for achieving the rewards of affluence reinforces the value of limiting family size

  - UN predicts a nominal projection of around 9.1 billion people in the middle of the 21st century


- Resources and Consumption: Water, Land, and Energy

  - Worldwide resource consumption is:
    - High
    - Getting higher
    - Increasing faster than population
  - Resource consumption increased steadily in the industrial era, accelerated in the late 20th century, and has now reached the point where we have to bring technology to bear in order to solve our issues
  - Water Resources
    - The good news about water is that it's renewable
    - The bad news is that it's not always present where we need it and climate change is making it increasingly scarce in some populated regions
    - According to *Beyond the Limits*:
      - 67% of available water is lost through flood runoff
      - 23% is accessible to inhabited areas
      - 10% is in uninhabited areas
      - We are now near limits of presently accessible resources
        - As a result, we need to exploit water from more remote areas, flood runoff, and from other sources
    - LA provides a good example of how a large urban area is trying to ensure that its water needs continue to be met in the face of challenges from climate change
      - 115 years ago, LA solved its water problems by bringing it from remote areas via aqueducts
      - Valley bloomed with agriculture and homes after the project's completion
      - Increasing incidence of drought means the aqueducts can no longer be relied on to meet the city's needs
        - City planners are now turning to storm runoff and used water
  - Land Resources
    - Prediction that the world would run out of agricultural land available to feed its population around the time that the population would be peaking according to other estimates
      - In order to stay within the available land limit, the present agricultural yields would have to be doubled
      - Situation has become more critical since this prediction
        - Increasing use of land for grazing of meat animals rather than for agriculture
        - Greater use of cropland for raising biofuel plants rather than food plants
        - Effects of climate change
  - Energy Resources
    - Sources of energy divided into two main categories:
      - Fossil sources (oil, natural gas, coal, etc.)
        - Limited, even though limits may be unclear
      - Renewable sources (solar, wind, hydro power, marine energy, etc.)
        - No immediately discernable limits

- Energy Sources and their Evolution

  - The history of energy consumption in the US demonstrates the great cumulative effect of the industrial revolution and the tremendous growth of world economy in the 20th century
    - Steep increase in energy consumption reflects continued industrialization, growth of population, development of cities and public transportation, and increasing use of societal amenities such as air conditioning and personal cars
    - Mostly from increased use of hydrocarbons (petroleum, natural gas, coal) resources
  - The Energy Information Administration (EIA) predicted ~10 years ago that world energy consumption would continue to rise, and that it would rise regardless of the world's economic growth
    - What will be the main sources going forward?
    - Depends on economics – the price we're willing to pay for energy – and on ethics and self-preservation
      - Oil is remarkably inexpensive
  - The pressure to move away from oil and natural gas as primary energy sources depends how much is left to extract
    - Estimates vary, but center around 40-50 years
    - Estimates may increase somewhat due to new extraction methods like fracking and new extraction locations, but are unlikely to change greatly
  - In long range terms, our hydrocarbon-based energy resources are severely limited and extremely harmful in ecological terms
    - New sources are currently being developed and fielded at increasingly large scales

- Viable Energy Alternatives

  - Most active alternatives are wind and solar energy, both of which have created major industries to produce, distribute, and install the energy-generating products
  - Nuclear power may be making a comeback, both in conventional land-based reactors and other innovative approaches
    - Despite belief that it is unsafe, as it is a rational approach to large-scale production of clean energy
    - Several startups have shown the feasibility of producing gasoline using carbon capture technology
      - Yet to be installed at an economically feasible industrial scale
      - Offers a form of carbon stability, stabilizing the carbon level, but not reducing it
  - Hard for alternative energy to make great headway while oil and gas are still cheap, but trending upwards
  - Ethical use of energy and other resources is complicated by growing affluence in the world's growing population

- Benefits and Costs of Affluence

  - Increasing the affluence, or individual and family wealth of the world's population, is generally accepted as a worthwhile goal
    - Puts a severe burden on the world's resources
  - Utilitarian Analysis
    - What is the objective?
      - Provide the most happiness for the most people
    - Who are the people?
      - The world's population; and in particular, the currently poor and middle classes of the less industrialized companies
    - What is the starting point?
      - Great historical disproportion; but rapidly changing dynamics among nations and areas
    - What is happiness?
      - Freedom from poverty and its effects, a comfortable income with which to secure desirable as well as necessary products, a lifestyle commensurate with that of the more industrialized countries
    - What does such happiness cost?
      - Scarce resources
    - How will we solve the problem implicit in achieving happiness while conserving resources when happiness depends on resources?
      - Most likely need new resource technology in several key areas
      - Also need a new set of world ethics to ensure equitable use of what we already have and what we will produce in the future

  - Historical Disproportions
    - In terms of income, the difference between the 20% richest countries and the 20% poorest countries has been tremendous, and has not decreased significantly in over half a century
    - Major differences in overall energy consumption between the more industrialized and the less industrialized countries
      - Reflected in impact, as defined by the combined effect of population, affluence, and technology (PAT)
  - Individual Affluence
    - The world in 2000 could be roughly divided into three classes:
      - ~20% of the world was poor, with a diet of insufficient grain, unsafe drinking water, and no transportation other than walking
      - ~60% of the world was middle class, with a diet of grain and some meat, safe water, and primary transport by bicycle or public buses
      - ~20% of the world was consumer class, with a diet of meat and packaged food, soft drinks as well as water, and primary transport by private car
    - Overall movement in the 21st century has generally been out of poverty and into middle class, and from the middle class to the consumer class
      - In this period, the distributions of income in important countries has moved toward larger annual incomes, and more people are included in the income populations
      - Projections of individual income into the future continue this trend
  - Affluence and Food
    - What does this movement mean for the already increasing worldwide consumption of resources?
      - Exemplified by the effect on water resources as people become more affluent and their choice of food changes
    - Meat production, and beef in particular, extracts a high cost both in dollars and in world resources/environmental pollution
      - Agriculture uses the most fresh water of any activity, and livestock uses 1/3 of agricultural water
      - Livestock feed uses 1/3 of arable land, turning what was previously a carbon sink into a carbon spigot because of the amount of greenhouse gas cattle produce
      - Livestock produce 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and cattle represent 2/3 of livestock emissions
      - One solution is to convince increasingly affluent people to stop craving meat by finding an acceptable and less damaging substitute
  - Affluence and Transport
    - An indicator of consumer class was personal transport by car
    - On a worldwide basis, transport represents ~20% of total energy use
    - Projections for growth in car population show that the US will remain relatively steady, but other countries will develop rapidly, especially China
    - For cars to maintain their current percentage of energy use, it is estimated they have to average 60mi/gal by 2030 and 400mi/gal by 2100
      - The second number seems beyond the reach of current car technology, so changes will be necessary if the car population is to continually grow
    - In LA, we've seen a gradual shift from gasoline-powered cars to fuel-efficient cars
    - Another approach is to go all-electric
      - Ex) Tesla
      - On a component level, these vehicles are zero-emission, but the electricity used to power them is typically generated by fossil fuels and delivered over an inefficient electrical grid, resulting in them being less "green" than high-mileage/hybrid alternatives
      - Solution for zero-emission cars is to have the whole system be zero-emission, and delivering it through an intelligent grid

- A Point of Inflection

  - In *A New Reality*, Dr. Jonathan Salk states we're at a critical point of inflection with regard to our resources and strategies for continued well-being
  - Today and in the future, the relevant factors are:
    - Population growth slowing and either holding steady or declining
    - More realistic expectations of industry and technology
    - Many natural resources approaching limits
  - There are greater advantages to cooperation, interdependence, and strategies that ensure sustainability, as well as improved quality of life

- A New Global Ethical Framework

  - Our commons today is the entire planet, and the components that are of most concern are:
    - Limited resources: fossil fuels, arable land, and mineral ores
    - Water: with respect to pollution of surface waters and ground aquifers
    - Forests: for oxygen production, carbon reduction, and materials
    - Atmosphere: in terms of pollution and effects on climate change
    - Oceans and coral reefs: for their contributions to food and beauty
    - Wilderness: for ecological balance, animal refuge, and human escape
    - Species: for sustaining biodiversity and biological resources
  - Today, governments, organizations, and companies act in ways that endanger or destroy the commons, and there is a consensus that we need a worldwide ethical agreement on resource rights and duties
  - The ethical duties of engineers specifically will fall into the following areas:
    - Analysis: to measure and analyze the current situation using the best equipment and methods available, predict future conditions through modelling and simulation, establish technical requirements for control and mitigation, and create new strategies for a sustainable environment
    - Innovation and development: to improve current methods, and develop totally new approaches and technologies
    - Communication: most important, to convey the facts both to policy makers and the public in a form that is understandable, transparent, and above all, truthful

- Summary

  - We are at a critical point of inflection
  - Increases are still occurring both in the world's population and in people's economic aspirations
  - As a result, there are significant stresses on our common resources, environment, and energy
  - Technology and engineering are central to both creating problems and solving them
  - The next 20-50 years will likely be critical
  - Predicting future outcomes is very difficult



## Reading 9: Environmental Ethics

- The Environment: Ethical Overview
  - The worldwide environment shows how humans live today and affects the lives of future humans beings and species
  - We must solve the environmental problems of today considering the ethical key principles:
    - Rights ethics: the right of the world's population to a safe and healthy environment
    - Duty ethics: the understanding that if we're breaking it, it's our duty to fix it
    - Virtue ethics: the obligations of virtue as part of world citizenship
    - Utilitarianism: how to provide the most happiness for the most people, and how to balance benefits and costs in an increasingly dangerous time
    - Pragmatism: the frequent need for antagonists to compromise in order to reach rational solutions, local as well as worldwide

  - We currently face a number of very serious environmental problems:
    - Depletion of natural resources, exacerbated by the growing affluence of the world's popuation
    - The industrialization of the environment
    - Industrial technology meets natural phenomena
- Case Study 1: Los Angeles Smog
  - Starting in the 1950s, the widespread introduction of cars into SoCal created a unique product known as photochemical smog
    - The action of sunlight on the waste products of gasoline engines led to a variety of chemical reactions, culminating in the creation of ozone in the air
    - Toxic and corrosive to human lungs

  - LA attacked the smog problem by:
    - Analyzing the problem: scientific studies highlighted the contributions of the various smog elements as well as the role of local geography
    - Regulating locally and statewide: both the city and California began to put into place standards for ozone, particulates, and other elements
    - Banning home incinerators: citywide trash collection replaced the role of home burning, eliminating the smoke component of LA smog
    - Reducing photochemical smog: required all new cars to have catalytic convertors that changed their exhaust to a less toxic chemical mix, installed nozzle shields at filling pumps to prevent unburned gas from escaping, and changed the composition of the gas itself to promote a cleaner exhaust
    - Converting local industry: the major factories disappeared, largely due to the expansion of the residential area, and were replaced by numerous smaller plants whose waste products could be more easily controlled

  - Success defined by the average ozone concentration and the number of days annually that the concentration exceeded the federal health standard
    - Uptick in the amount of car and truck emissions in the last few years
    - Increase in the number of bad days for ozone concentration due to warming local temperatures
    - Trends could be exacerbated by the rollback of clean air regulations

- Case Study 2: The Ozone Hole
  - Cause of the ozone hole over the Antarctic region is the increasing concentration of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
    - Used in industrial processes and in aerosol containers

  - Same approach as the LA case
  - Problems:
    - Switch from chlorofluorocarbons to hydrofluorocarbons has been implicated as the cause for climate change caused by human activity
    - Potential decreases in ozone concentration centered around the world's population

- Case Study 3: Climate Change
  - The Greenhouse Effect
    - Divided into stages:
      - Sunlight energy normally enters the Earth's atmosphere
      - Most of the energy is absorbed to heat the Earth
      - Some energy is immediately reflected, particularly from the snow and ice at the poles
      - A substantial portion of the reflected energy moves through the near atmosphere to the higher atmosphere and is gone
      - Currently, energy is being trapped and returned to the Earth's surface by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which function in the same way as glass does in the traditional greenhouse

    - Key greenhouse gases include:
      - Carbon dioxide: from burning fossil fuels for power generation and for transportation
      - Methand: from industrial processes and from agriculture, in particular from beef production
      - Nitrous oxide: from soils under natural vegetation and agriculture
      - Ozone: from photochemical reaction of carbon-based fuels
      - Water vapor: from numerous water sources and from the oceans

  - The Facts
    - The global average temperature has been rising steadily for over 150 years, and has risen at a higher rate since the middle of the 20th century
      - At the same time, there has been a dramatic rise in the concentration of greenhouse gases

  - The Cause
    - The rise in global temperature is due to the increase in the greenhouse gases that are primarily the result of industrial processes and related social activities

  - The Divided Political Situation
    - The division between climate change believers and skeptics follows political lines, preventing the US from taking needed actions on a national level
    - As administrations change from party to party, government actions regarding climate change are dramatically different

  - Dire Anticipated Effects
    - Melting of polar ice and glaciers combined with hearting of the oceans causing a rise in ocean levels from 2-3 feet in some locations and up to 15 feet in others
    - More severe weather events such as floods, droughts, storms, and wildfires caused by changes in global temperature patterns combined with more moisture in the air due to ocean and land warming
    - Unequal societal changes in the quality of life, potentially causing extreme violence and warfare in fighting over land and resources

  - A Rational Solution: Target and Approach
    - Severe reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, focusing on carbon

  - Local Solutions
    - Reflective streets: created by substituting more reflective materials for the heat-absorbing concrete and asphalt common today
    - Reflective roofs: the same approach applied to roofing materials
    - More trees: to provide shade as well as carbon dioxide absorption and oxygen production

  - A Fallback Solution
    - If straightforward measures fail, the nations of the world might turn to the more radical climate engineering
    - Deliberate intervention in the Earth's climate system with the aim of mitigating the adverse effects of global warming
    - Focus on removing the carbon from the atmosphere by various means
    - Emulate the effect of large-scale volcanic eruptions by introducing manufactured particles into the atmosphere to reduce temperatures on the surface
      - Carry major risks of unknown consequences, and would likely be only a last-ditch effort

  - A Societal Approach
    - Emphasis on the need for humanity to change its relationship with nature, as well as to one another

- Case Study 4: Waste Management
  - Industrial Waste
    - A number of sources produce industrial waste, which is all dangerous to some extent
    - Adverse ecological effects include challenges to human health through direct exposure, damage to or destruction of plant and animal species, and contamination of the human food chain

- Ethical Example: A New Industrial Paradigm
  - Product designs from the beginning should incorporate the product's next iteration
  - The first Industrial Revolution has the following characteristics:
    - Generates gigantic amounts of waste
    - Puts billions of pounds of toxic material into air, water, and soil yearly
    - Requires constant vigilance of highly dangerous materials
    - Buries valuable materials
    - Necessitates thousands of complex regulations
    - Creates prosperity through destruction of natural resources
    - Erodes the eco-environment

  - A new industrial revolution would have the following objectives:
    - Produce products that become food for plants, animals, and soil or raw materials for new products
    - Develop factories whose outlet water is cleaner than inlet water
    - Construct buildings that produce more energy than they consume
    - Accrue trillions of dollars worth of new materials each year
    - Create a world of abundance rather than one of limits, pollution, and waste

- Summary
  - Key goals for the 21st century:
    - Improved sources of quality water, likely involving new ways of retaining runoff water and recycling previously used water
    - Increased food production, taking into account the limitations in arable land area and the effects of increasing affluence on food preferences
    - "Clean" energy for power generation and transportation that does not add to, and perhaps even subtracts from, greenhouse gas accumulation
    - "Waste-free" product manufacturing and usage, potentially involving the small or large aspects of the cradle-to-cradle concept
    - Better overall quality of life for the growing human population
    - Protection of the complete ecosystem including future human generations, as well as valuable species

  - Ethical engineering to accomplish these goals requires:
    - Understanding (and agreeing on) the problems that society faces
    - Setting correct priorities for addressing them
    - Developing innovative new technological solutions both by building on previous accomplishments and by creating surprising new ones
    - Ensuring that the solutions don't make things worse, even though this is a difficult thing to ensure
