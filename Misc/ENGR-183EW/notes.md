## Reading 1: Introduction

- Overview and Objectives
  - Ethical philosophies and case studies
    - Establish the bases for our Western ideas of ethics and morals
    - Examine in detail five major ethical philosophies that are helpful to engineering analyses
    - Apply these philosophies as part of case studies
  - 21st-century technological/societal issues
    - Discuss a number of critical problem areas worldwide in which technology and ethical considerations are connected
    - Examine routes to both technical and ethical solutions
  - Personal ethical framework
    - Help understand, augment, and strengthen your ethical framework
    - Ethical action is personal and a strong personal framework will facilitate proper action
  - Specific course objectives:
    - Prepare students to address society's critical technical issues as highly qualified and ethical engineering professionals
      - These technical issues will in most cases involve societal and ethical consideration along with their scientific and technical aspects
    - Help students build a personal ethical framework to use in identifying and applying the ethical principles affecting these issues
      - The personal ethical framework is the basis for ethical action
      - Strengthened by our discussion of ethical bases and philosophies
    - Provide an understanding of how technology and society influence one another
      - Knowing how technology and society have influenced us in the past gives us a framework of understanding for current issues
      - Allows us to put facts into context and to understand their implications
      - Allows us to recognize where we are now and to decide on where we should be going
    - Examine critical contemporary societal issues that involve both technology and other factors
      - Provide a look-ahead into the future and a means of trying out the ethical philosophies and considerations we have previously learned
    - Provide guidelines and methodology for making ethical engineering decisions
      - Learning to make better decisions can have a significant effect on success in engineering, as well as in life
      - Examine naturalistic and analytical decision-making and present several ways of performing a quantitative analysis that combines technical and societal considerations
    - Provide knowledge to improve performance in working on and leading diverse temas
      - Successful engineering depends on both taskwork skills and teamwork skills
      - The importance of teamwork skills is heightened in today's international, distributed, and highly diverse working environment
    - Illuminate the path to continued learning
      - Ethics is a lifelong enterprise
      - How resources available through modern technology can support continued learning
- The Value of Our Engineering and Society Course
  - Complete you as an engineer
  - Help you value your contribution
  - Provide a guide to action
  - Influence your personal life
  - Show you a direction
  - Help understand what it takes to be ethical
  - Do general and personal good
  - Provide an immediate goal

- The Two Cultures
  - Observation that the portion of British society that had received a university education was split into those educated in the sciences and those educated in the humanities
    - Main issue was that the great majority of British leaders were part of the humanities culture and had more and more issues related to science and technology
    - Argument that society's leaders were poorly prepared to carry out their responsibility for solving society's problems of the day and of the future
    - Proposal for cross education in universities => not well received and modern universities are even more specialized than before

  - New problem: when it comes to science and technology, things move so quickly that political leaders aren't leading, they're struggling to keep up
    - Internet, biotechnology, gene editing, social media, data acquisition, surveillance technology, etc.
    - Conclusion: cross education of leaders would be relatively useless, instead, we need the engineers and scientists must make themselves aware of the consequences of their work

  - Note the frequent discrepancy between how engineers see themselves and how others see them
    - Engineers typically see themselves as creative, wide ranging, solution oriented, and rational
    - The public tends to see engineers as overly analytical, unbounded, emphasizing problems over people, and consequently dangerous
      - Must be taken into account when communicating our solutions to the public at large
      - The ethical and societal implications of our work have to be conveyed along with the technical details

- Existential Ethics and Decision-Making
  - A definition of ethics that would be generally accepted without comment is: "Ethics is a set of ideas and rules by which to live"
    - Better definition for this class: "Ethics is not only a set of ideas and rules by which to live; but ethics is fundamentally a set of acts based on ideas and rules by which to live"

  - Base idea that existence precedes essence
    - A person is what he or she does, rather than does because of what he or she is
    - Acts are more important than words, and this acts define a person's ethical structure, not his or her pronouncements

  - Decisions are actions, and engineers are required to make decisions continually, thus establishing the basis for defining their ethical framework
    - Engineering decisions often are simultaneously analytical and probabilistic
    - Engineers are often alright with time constraints on their decisions
    - More and more, engineering decisions are multiperson and multiorganizations
    - Generally involve both technical and societal factors
    - Engineering decisions are consequential, with consequences today happening at a speed and to an extent never before experienced
      - One wrong engineering decision can have an instantaneous and serious effect on millions or even billions of people

    - Ethics is sometimes the controlling factor, meaning that ethical considerations are more important than the financial ones
      - More frequently, ethical or societal considerations are another factor in the overall decision-making process

    - Ethical decision-making is the natural product of an ethical culture
      - Can be expressed at the team and group level within an organization, as organizational standards and operating principles
      - The higher we go, the more difficult it becomes to instantiate such a culture

    - Ethical decision-making depends on two questions:
      - "What do you stand for?"
      - "What do you do about it?"

  - Emphasis on the difference between "having ethics" and "being ethical"
    - When the course is over, we "have ethics"
    - The task of "being ethical" is a lifelong undertaking that depends on our actions

- The Engineering Profession
  - The environment in which engineers practice has changed dramatically over the years
  - Engineers have gone from a simple employee of a company to more of an entrepreneur with a company of his or her own, or a serial employee
  - Consequences of engineering work have grown more immediate, transparent, and widespread
  - Engineers have two main sources of professional ethics:
    - Outside sources, like the ethical codes of the various engineering fields and the codes of overarching societies for general engineering
    - The personal ethical framework of the individual engineer
